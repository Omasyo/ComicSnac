After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben</a> and <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> in a <a href=\"/forest-hills-residence/4020-57247/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57247\">modest house</a> in Forest Hills, <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>. While still in <a href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\">High School</a>, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a <a href=\"/radioactive-spider/4055-56442/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56442\">radioactive spider</a>, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a \"<a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a>\" that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities - and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against <a href=\"/crusher-hogan/4005-15480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15480\">Crusher Hogan</a>. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterward while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn't his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger, Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben's killer, Peter saw that it was the same <a href=\"/the-burglar/4005-15279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15279\">burglar</a> he didn't stop at the arena... thus learning that \"<a href=\"/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/4015-40616/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40616\">with great power comes great responsibility</a>\".</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\"><img alt=\"Spidey's First Appearance\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Spidey's First Appearance</figcaption></figure><p>In 1962, <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a> editor and head writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> was looking for a new superhero idea. He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired by the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman</a> to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/4050-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a>, which was renamed <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for an initial character design. However, Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby's attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is one of the first characters whose problems made him feel more real, as people could relate more to him.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death, he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.</p><p>He has an extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on the said side.</p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate periods.</p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore, The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.</p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 - Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle's death. Even though <a href=\"/maxie-shiffman/4005-25215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\">Maxie Shiffman</a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn't want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death, Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"/mr-vale/4005-83138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83138\">Mr. Vale</a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"/the-undertaker/4005-83137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83137\">The Undertaker</a>. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight, he discovered his <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a> for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben's death, by using his powers to help others.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.66429298067141\" data-width=\"983\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 983px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2349326\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 983w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117930/2349326-spider_man2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn't want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility for money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"/josephine-pulaski/4005-25313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25313\">Joey Pulaski</a> became friends. However, it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">The Kingpin</a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey's defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super-powered being Spider-Man had encountered.</p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man's fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. As the host began to introducing the show's guests he was attacked by the super-powered villain <a href=\"/supercharger/4005-41244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41244\">Supercharger</a>, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super-powered beings were. Spider-Man had never encountered a super villain before and thought real superheroes should deal with this. He attempted to call <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain. \"because that's what superheroes do\".</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Becoming a Hero</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61647727272727\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 704px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\"><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death</figcaption></figure><p>Peter's first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chameleon</a> who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Vulture</a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape-shifting <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a>, the lethal <a href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">Lizard</a>, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"/enforcers/4060-32265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a>, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, and his soon-to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"../../sinister-six/65-40429/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinister Six</a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> and <a href=\"/betty-brant/4005-2484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\">Betty Brant</a>. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"/molten-man/4005-11554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11554\">Molten Man</a>, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of <a href=\"/liz-allan/4005-15408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\">Liz Allen</a>. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">the X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, and the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with <a href=\"/ned-leeds/4005-12354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12354\">Ned Leeds</a>.</p><h3>College Years</h3><p>After graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a>) where Flash introduced him to <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually, their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"../../anna-may-watson/29-33193/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anna Watson's</a> niece <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mary Jane</a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, <a href=\"../../captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Police Captain George Stacy</a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in <a href=\"../../london/34-55798/\" rel=\"nofollow \">London</a>.</p><h3>Arch-Nemesis: Green Goblin</h3><p>After suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter's Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority.

He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. Gwen's death has affected Peter his entire career and is a big part of his character, as was Uncle Ben's death. He tracked the Goblin down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"../../jackal/29-10974/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Miles Warren</a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>. He hired the <a href=\"../../punisher/29-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Punisher</a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Peter copy</a> escaped and <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy-clone/29-52936/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gwen's copy</a> eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father's death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry's psychologist, <a href=\"../../bart-hamilton/29-34978/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bart Hamilton</a> attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.</p><h3>Secret Wars and the Symbiote</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5324324324324\" data-width=\"370\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 370px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beyonder</a> transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Battleworld</a> to take place in the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Secret Wars</a>, an intergalactic battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man's suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">black substance</a> that slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Arachne's</a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reed Richards</a> who told him that it's actually a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">living alien symbiote</a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit's design, Spider-Man's then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a> made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Eddie Brock</a> to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Venom</a>.</p><h3>Death of Jean DeWolff</h3><p>A close friend of Peter's, <a href=\"/jean-dewolff/4005-2471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\">Jean DeWolff</a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"/sin-eater/4005-11206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater</a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side. After saving Betty Brant from the criminal, Spider-Man was tempted to kill him but was stopped by <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>.

Black Cat appears to reconcile with Peter which caused MJ to run away crying. She considered leaving town again but she then decided to confront Peter. They became very close and they would tell each other everything. They were hiding from their true feelings and Peter proposed to MJ. Although she initially refused, after making amends with her <a href=\"/gayle-watson/4005-84116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84116\">sister</a>, MJ returned to Peter and accepted his proposal.

Kraven was seeking to regain the honor that his family had lost and to do so, he must prove his superiority over his greatest foe, Spider-Man. After ambushing him, Kraven shot Peter in the head with a rifle and buried him on his grounds. Kraven donned a black Spider-Man costume and became a merciless vigilante. He even defeated <a href=\"../../vermin/29-6818/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Vermin</a>, a villain Spider-Man could not defeat on his own. After two weeks, it was revealed that Spider-Man was actually alive and Kraven shot him with a tranquilizer. Peter eventually made his way to Kraven's estate and brutally pummeled the hunter.

He then became very angry with Spider-Man, when the web-slinger unmasked Sin-Eater and it turned out to be a different person. This caused Brock professional humiliation and the loss of his job. When Eddie bonded with the symbiote and became <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Venom</a>, Eddie launched several attacks on Peter's life, even scaring MJ. Peter stopped wearing the black suit following MJ's request.

Sometime later, Peter and Eddie formed a truce, promising never to interfere with each other's lives ever again.</p><h3>Death of Harry Osborn</h3><p>Harry Osborn's memories of being the Green Goblin came flooding back and he attempted to ruin Peter's life one more time. Before destroying a building that contained Peter, MJ, and his son <a href=\"../../normie-osborn/29-11552/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Normie</a>, Harry regained his sanity and managed to save them.

He had learned to love his \"parents\" and even revealed to them his secret identity. They turned out to be robots invented by the Chameleon to infiltrate Peter's life, discover his connections to Spider-Man and then kill him. The robot that masqueraded as Peter's father Richard was perfectly willing to accomplish his task and kill Peter, but the Mary robot had learned to love Peter and saw him as a good person. Richard turned into a vicious engine of destruction. Before Richard could finish Peter off, Mary killed him using an electric cable. In return, she was killed by the Vulture who was conspiring with the Chameleon. An enraged Spider-Man completely pummeled the Vulture but was stopped by the cries of his dying \"mother\". She told Peter in her last moments that despite everything, she still loved him. Spider-Man vowed to track down the Chameleon and make him suffer, which he eventually did after fighting through many assassins sent by the communist.

For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ben Reilly</a> spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first, the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a threat, but later on, the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand-in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, until his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.</p><h3>The Identity Crisis</h3><p>After this saga, the <a href=\"/spider-man-identity-crisis/4045-55684/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55684\">Identity Crisis</a> story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, who had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man's head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually, Peter's name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.</p><h3>Gathering of the Five</h3><p>It seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity, and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a lifetime. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why 'aunt May' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary Jane.</p><h3>A New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ratio=\"1.1566820276498\" data-width=\"651\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 651px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\"><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman</figcaption></figure><p>After Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter's good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder than it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, who got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to life as a superhero.</p><p>All seemed to go well again until Mary Jane, who had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary Jane's death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter's memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man's fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time off from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.</p><h3>A Death in the Family</h3><p>Norman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called <a href=\"../../a-death-in-the-family/39-56294/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A Death in the Family</a>. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen's death to the media, claiming that Gwen's death was the result of Spider-Man's selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn's warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin's game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.</p><h3>Ezekiel</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man and Ezekiel</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, who knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy who will try to kill him, known as Morlun. Peter follows Ezekiel and tries to find out why he knows so much about him. Ezekiel tells Spider-man that he is part of a \"Spider-Totem\", which is why his enemies all are animals as well (Rhino, Lizard, Doctor Octopus, Vulture). Spider-man does not care much about these strange stories but is happy with the help that Ezekiel provides when he finally encounters Morlun. He barely defeats Morlun and struggles back home after the fight. He lands on his bed, with a torn-up Spider-man costume and falls asleep. It is at this time that aunt May enters the room and sees Peter as Spider-Man. The secret is finally out! Aunt May walks away and uses a full day to comprehend the facts before she finally confronts Peter with it. Peter tried to talk his way out of it but finally sees that it is no use and then told his aunt May about why he became Spider-Man. It was during this time that Peter and Mary Jane again renewed their relationship and their marriage vows. Marry-Jane returned to live with Peter and the two were a happy couple once more.</p><h3>New Avengers</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056899\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5013333333333\" data-width=\"750\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056899\"><img alt=\"Spider-man Joins The New Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 750w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 426w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man Joins The New Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 750w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056899-new_avengers_by_summerset.jpg 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man Joins The New Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>During a riot at the <a href=\"../../the-raft/34-50736/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Raft</a> prison, orchestrated by <a href=\"../../electro/29-3228/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Electro</a>, Spider-Man teams up with other heroes to subdue the inmates.

Identity intact thanks to his unstabilized mask, he escaped (subduing Norman and Bullseye in succession out of anger). Unfortunately, Spider-Man was weakened by captivity, saved from Norman by a guilt-ridden and angry Harry, who now knew the truth about his father's relationship with <a href=\"/menace/4005-50406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50406\">Lily Hollister</a> (Harry's girlfriend,) and began using the American Son Armor to beat up Norman. Peter watched the Osborns fight until Menace became involved, whom he incapacitated. With Harry victorious, Spider-Man convinced him not to kill Norman as it was exactly what the madman wanted.</p><h3>Gauntlet &amp; Grim Hunt</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2057063\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4410646387833\" data-width=\"263\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 263px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2057063\"><img alt=\"Grim Hunt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" data-width=\"263\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg 263w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Grim Hunt\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2057063-detail.jpg 263w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 263px) 100vw, 263px\" data-width=\"263\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Grim Hunt</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-man fights classic foes during the <a href=\"../../the-gauntlet/39-55984/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gauntlet</a> story. A plot orchestrated by the <a href=\"../../kravinoff-family/65-57327/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kravinoff Family</a> who intended to recover <a href=\"../../kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kraven the Hunter,</a> something they managed to accomplish in the <a href=\"../../grim-hunt/39-56152/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Grim Hunt</a>.</p><p>During Grim Hunt, Peter is already weakened and exhausted from his \"gauntlet\". After a loud knocking at his apartment door and he opens it only to see his estranged clone Kaine, beaten and bloodied. Before passing out, Kaine reveals to Peter that the \"Spiders\" are being hunted. A loud explosion is heard nearby his apartment and Peter goes to check it out only to see Arachne fighting off Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff. Peter, being weakened by the swine flu, struggles to put up a fight and manages to impale Alyosha on a broken pipe, gaining him time to retrieve Arachne and to escape. After retreating to Mattie Franklin's apartment, they are approached by a dead Ezekiel. He then tells Spider-Man and Arachne that they have to save Arana from the clutches of the Kravinoff's. As they finally reach her, they become outnumbered and defeated and Arachne and Arana are captured. Kaine eventually arrives to help out but was too late to make a difference. He tries to warn Peter from following Ezekiel but Peter lashes out in anger and the two set off to find Kraven's base.</p><p>When they finally reach the base, Chameleon reveals himself as being disguised as Ezekiel the entire time. Spider-man then gets ambushed and killed by the Kravinoff's. With Kraven finally back from the dead, he shows his anger at Sasha by confirming that the blood was not that of the real Spider-Man but of his clone Kaine. When Peter awakens, he finds Kaine's body in a coffin with a note reading \"Hunt me\" and his black costume lying beside the coffin. Spider-Man begins to hunt the Kravinoff's one by one, first taking out Chameleon and nearly killing Vladimir with a giant tombstone before dodging a point-blank shot from Alyosha's rifle. Spider-man than appears on the roof of the mansion and attacks Sasha, leaving the mark of Kaine on her face (using his finger's abilities to rip the skin off of her face) in revenge for the death of his clone and \"brother\". Spider-Man and Kraven then proceed to engage into battle and the fight proves to be completely one-sided as Peter goes all out with the intentions of killing Kraven for the murders of his friends. As he is about to deliver the killing blow to Kraven with his own spear, Arachne (As the new Madame Web) appears and shows Spider-man a grim future that would follow if he decided to murder Kraven. Spider-Man lets Kraven live and tells him that it's his second and last chance to live.</p><p>They were still defeated by Spider-Man, Arachne, and <a href=\"../../spider-girl/29-40598/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Arana</a>.

As Spider-Man, Peter has become a much more respected member of the Super-Hero community. Additionally, thanks to <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a>, Peter has become a think tank scientist at <a href=\"/horizon-labs/4020-57110/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs</a> under the employ of known scientist <a href=\"/max-modell/4005-74419/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74419\">Max Modell</a>. <a href=\"/hobgoblin/4005-7605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7605\">Roderick Kingsley</a> is murdered by a crazed <a href=\"/phil-urich/4005-2246/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2246\">Phil Urich</a> who takes up the mantle of the Hobgoblin. He takes on the mission Kingpin initially assigned to Kingsley, which involved stealing a metal called reverbium from Horizon Labs. On Peter's first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth Suit (Which has the ability to turn invisible.) to overcome Phil's Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous encounter. Along with the Black Cat, he attempts to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin, and his Hand Ninjas. The reverbium is destroyed along with Fisk Towers, and Hobgoblin and Kingpin escape. But despite everything, Peter is now living a life with his dignity intact. He now has a new girlfriend, a new apartment, and a proud Aunt May and Jay Sr. Part 2 <a href=\"/alistair-smythe/4005-6292/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6292\">Alistair Smythe</a> and his Spider-Slayers are back and taking aim at Mayor J. Jonah Jameson and his astronaut son <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John</a> once again. Smythe returns Mac Gargan to his <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a> identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a <a href=\"/horizon-labs/4020-57110/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs</a> space station. Spider-Man appears and web lines to a shuttle that just took off. Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere.</p><p>To make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man. But with secret help from Otto Octavius Spider-Man saves John. He gets help from the New Avengers in defending Jonah but Smythe sends his <a href=\"/army-of-insects/4060-58079/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58079\">Insect Army</a> after Jonah's loved ones. But Spidey and his friends cannot hurt the Insect Army, they can barely even touch them, as Smythe gave them their own spider-sense. Peter with the help of Max Modell creates the spider-sense disruptor. He is given the detonator and must be far from the center of the \"explosion\" or his sense might be also caught in. But during the second fight against the Scorpion, Scorpion destroys the detonator, and Spider-Man must do it manually. And when he detonates it he is caught in the epicenter. The Insect Army has lost the spider-sense, but so has Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe suddenly appears and Spider-Man had not seen it coming due to not having spider-sense, but <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a> did. She jumps right in front of Jonah, and saves him but scarifies her own life in the process. Spider-Man then defeats Smythe and for the first time, Jonah refuses to blame Spider-Man and blames himself instead.</p><p>Following Marla's funeral, Peter has a horrible nightmare that causes him to question his methods of dealing with criminals. People around him are dying because criminals keep on coming back. After waking up, a shaken Spider-Man decides that things will not remain as they are and vows that, whenever he is around and wherever he is, no one dies.</p><h3>Spider-Island</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056894\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4290909090909\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056894\"><img alt=\"Welcome To Spider-Island\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 447w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Welcome To Spider-Island\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056894-550w_comics_spider_island_cover3.jpg 447w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" data-width=\"447\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Welcome To Spider-Island</figcaption></figure><p>Peter is shown to be learning the 'Way of the Spider', from Shang-Chi, and also seen neutralizing a couple of robberies. Jackal is revealed to be working on a scheme, recruiting several spider-powered criminals for some kind of project. Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr. Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at a lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be 'tested'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider powers but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however, Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider's face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well. The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.</p><p>Reed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based on Anti-Venom's symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider-sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.</p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship with Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several Autobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.</p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire State Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.</p><h3>Ends of the Earth</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\"><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mind Controlled Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Doc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn't believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock's true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can't stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock's facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites, and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they're attacked by a group of mind-controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind-controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio's technology.</p><p>Black Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto's plot once and for all. They, unfortunately, meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he's running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc's metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable's life.</p><h3>No Turning Back</h3><p>It's been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock's plan and now Peter is invited to MJ's, which is Mary Jane's Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sable's death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come to meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the groundskeeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius' actions, starts to attack him but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period of time, but finally, Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor's back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt's body.</p><p>The Lizard awakens Morbius' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted by Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serum turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn't work. Only at the end, we see that the cure has actually worked, and now Connors' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard's body.</p><h3>Alpha</h3><p>A teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym, and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength, and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn't publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous.</p><p>He then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man's sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when the earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called by Captain America to fight him. During the fight, Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.</p><h3>Dying Wish</h3><p>Using a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter's memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus's dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man's life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock's own contingency plans had <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man</a> and <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a> free himself from the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> prison <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a>. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter's memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter's personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.</p><h3>Superior Spider-Man</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\"><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?</figcaption></figure><p>However, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus's mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life tries to influence Octavius but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker's remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter's genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl's brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker's presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter's memories.</p><p>After Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker's memories in an attempt to solve a reverbium related problem, Peter's consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter's consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote's hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.</p><p>Peter Parker's re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he's more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus's memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the number of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius's birth. Peter Parker's consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto's memories.</p><h3>Spider-Verse</h3><p>While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company, Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had, in fact, survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\" data-ratio=\"1.5443262411348\" data-width=\"564\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 564px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\"><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Web Warriors</figcaption></figure><p>Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk, Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099 A.D., the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.</p><p>The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjy Parker of Earth-982, respectively.</p><p>With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as \"Spider-Gwen,\" launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145.</p><p>With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing the memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.</p><h3>Rise and Fall of Parker Industries</h3><p>Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain. Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\" data-ratio=\"1.4008152173913\" data-width=\"736\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 736px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.1%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\"><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Web-Ware</figcaption></figure><p>As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter's life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.</p><p>One of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place.</p><p>The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide. The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webware transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, is a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.</p><p>Afterward, Peter teamed-up again with Teresa Durand, a CIA agent with whom Peter had already joined forces in a mission at least a year ago during which she was seemingly brainwashed by the Kingpin and Mentallo to believe she was Peter's long-lost sister. Teresa sought Peter's help when on the run from a government organization called the Gray Blade.</p><p>Hydra's take-over of the United States of America temporarily put a halt to Peter and Teresa's escapades. Numerous headquarters of Parker Industries around the globe were then targeted by the forces of the terrorist organization, namely a unit led by one of Hydra's latest additions, the duplicate of Doctor Octopus, who had gained a physical body through the Jackal's cloning technology.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort to prevent the resources of Parker Industries from falling in the hands of Octavius and Hydra, Parker had his employees obliterate all systems of the company, running Parker Industries into the ground. He later fought alongside the rest of America's superheroes that assembled in Washington, D.C. to retake the United States from Hydra's control.</p><p>Despite having his civilian reputation smeared due to his company's collapse, Peter quickly got back on his feet. After beginning a short-lived relationship with Parker Industries' former S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison Mockingbird, Peter was hired by Robbie Robertson as the editor for the Daily Bugle's science section.</p><p>Before Peter recovered himself, however, his adventure with Teresa continued, who discovered that she truly was Mary and Richard Parker's daughter, and shared this information with Peter.</p><p>Not long after Peter had decided to reveal his secret identity to Jameson, Jonah was kidnapped by Norman Osborn, and accidentally let it slip that Peter was Spider-Man. In addition to having regained his powers, Osborn had bonded with the Carnage Symbiote, giving birth to the Red Goblin.</p><p>Peter failed to take down Osborn despite the help from his allies, and was overpowered in battle even after Eddie Brock had lent him his symbiote. Peter only managed to defeat Osborn in a fight after tricking him into rejecting the symbiote, having claimed that any credit for his defeat would go to the Carnage symbiote and not Osborn himself. Unfortunately, the process of defeating Osborn cost the life of Spider-Man's biggest fan, Flash Thompson, who had recently become the superhero Agent Anti-Venom.</p><h3>Kindred Rising</h3><p>Following Osborn's defeat, Peter's life was presented with several tribulations. After becoming Mayor of NYC, Kingpin became publicly accepting of Spider-Man while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate the Web-Slinger from his super hero peers. In his civilian identity, Peter was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius. Unable to defend himself without exposing his secret identity, Peter had his credentials revoked, causing him to be fired from the Daily Bugle.</p><p>On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Curt Connors, leading Peter to re-enroll at the Empire State University to earn his college degree himself. Peter also moved into a shared apartment with Randy Robertson and Frederick Myers, the alter-ego of the super villain Boomerang, with whom Peter eventually developed a friendship both as Parker and Spider-Man.</p><p>During this time, Peter became the target of fixation of a mysterious supernatural entity that dubbed himself \"Kindred\" to hide his true identity, that of Harry Osborn, somehow turned into a demonic creature consumed by the belief that Peter had to repent for his sins and the misery he brought on his loved ones.</p><p>As Kindred, Harry pulled the strings of Peter's life to ensure no harm befell him until they could meet directly, while also forcing him and Mary Jane apart by employing Mysterio to have her career make her move to the West coast to film for some months. Kindred only presented himself to Peter in nebulous nightmares to further his psychological torment, leaving him with the uneasy sensation that somebody was lurking.</p><p>Due to Octavius' reckless experimentations with the Inheritor's technology, the totem-hunting family broke free from their prison, with Morlun personally going after Peter. Spider-Man was successful in defeating Morlun with the help of J. Jonah Jameson and the NYPD, and managed to join the reassembled Spider-Army in the final confrontation against the Inheritors that saw the defeat of the hunter family.</p><p>Peter's next big challenge presented itself when Kraven the Hunter hurtled him into a hunting contest alongside various animal-themed villains held in Central Park. Accompanied by a younger clone of himself he deemed his \"son,\" Kraven's ultimate goal was to goad Spider-Man into killing him, since only dying by the Web-Slinger's had would break his undead curse. During their final confrontation, Spider-Man convinced Kraven that true strength of character was best shown through compassion and mercy. Kraven called off the hunt and donned Spider-Man's costume to die in battle against his son. Since embracing Peter's ideals turned him into Spider-Man in spirit and because his death was deliberate, therefore by his own hand, the curse allowed Kraven to remain dead.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Peter became tangled in a conflict between Venom and the resurgent Carnage, who had become the herald of the Symbiote God Knull and embarked in a journey to retrieve symbiote remnants of people, dead or alive, who had been bound to a symbiote, in order to awaken Knull from his slumber. Spider-Man helped Venom's efforts to stop Kasady, most notably protecting Brock's son Dylan and Normie Osborn from Norman Osborn, who still believed himself to be Cletus Kasady and had been bonded to a copy of the Carnage symbiote by the real Kasady and turned into a pawn. Dark Carnage's reign of terror was stopped by Venom when he murdered Kasady to save Dylan's life, albeit causing himself to absorb Kasady's composite symbiote, awakening Knull.</p><p>Kindred would finally interact directly with Peter, setting the stage by resurrecting Stanley Carter, the Sin-Eater, and sending him on a campaign of vicious vigilantism, using new abilities to strip both the powers and wickedness off super villains, leaving them with a deep repentance. Under Kindred's orders, Sin-Eater targeted the restored Norman Osborn, the new director of the Ravencroft Institute. Initially conflicted, Peter chose to save Osborn, who became the Green Goblin again to fight in his escaping Sin-Eater. With help from his spider hero friends in The Order, Peter brought Osborn to an escape pod but Osborn's antagonism caused Peter to reconsider and abandoned Norman Osborn to Sin-Eater's mercy.</p><p>With Sin-Eater purifying Osborn, Kindred had the collected sins absorbed go out to possess and corrupt the Order. Managing to evade his possessed allies, Spider-Man sought Doctor Strange's help, later using a mystic artifact to locate Kindred's home at the Osborn family cemetery. Kindred staged the corpses of lost loved ones in a macabre scene, expressing his intentions to Peter, and eventually revealing himself as Harry. Kindred continuously killed and resurrected Peter as a direct torture, then forcing him to sit at a dinner alongside Mary Jane to repent for his perceived sins, including what Peter didn't remember that allegedly turned Harry into Kindred. The event was interrupted by Norman, who allied himself with Kingpin to capture Harry in a Darkforce cage.</p><p>While Spider-Man was liberated from Kindred's clutches, Peter was shaken to his core and knew that his and Mary Jane's ordeal with Kindred wasn't truly done. While drained emotionally, Mary Jane would give him an improvised therapy session to alleviate some hurt, regaining some hope in himself.</p><p>After Peter accepted Norah's TNM job offer, granting Spider-Man a new suit enhancing his physical attributes, Spider-Man and Boomerang continued collecting Tablet fragments and moved to secure the final piece. Rescuing an abducted Randy and Janice, Spider-Man aided Robbie and Tombstone with The Syndicate in taking down Madame Masque and Crime Master. With help from his New Avengers colleagues and Black Cat delivering Fisk's fragments, Spider-Man passed the final fragment's curse test, but Fred betrayed him with help from his cohorts. Felicia returned Peter to his ruined apartment to rest, later reading Fred's note explaining his long con before the others informed him that Fisk instead revived his son, The Rose. Quitting TNM and donating his pay to Aunt May's FEAST shelter, Peter met with Betty returned home from Europe, surprised by her advanced pregnancy.</p><h2>Personality</h2><dl><dd><i>Whether a law is right or wrong, moral or immoral, is an idea, a personal philosophy... but it always seems that fights over <b>ideas</b> skip over the barrier into the real world and become battles of real violence.</i><dl><dd>--<b>Spider-Man (Peter Parker)</b></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Spider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by Luke Cage when he felt embarrassed about Electro causing the Raft breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it. This combined with his strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel Universe.</p><p>One of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.</p><p>Behind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft and Norman Osborn's Initiative because they were \"his\" villains.</p><p>Death, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic proclamations, such as his \"Nobody dies!\" credo after Marla Madison's passing. Peter has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson, which was exacerbated by Kindred repeatedly killing and resurrecting him. Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died at the hands of Venom, Carnage, and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth.</p><p>Spider-Man is also traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the Avengers.</p><p>Peter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats like supporting the weight of a jet<sup>[344]</sup> and beating up Firelord. Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still remain in his personality.</p><p>Spider-Man's righteousness complimented Daredevil's maturity as a crime-fighter during the The Death of Jean DeWolff, leading to an enduring friendship. Peter also made close ties with the Fantastic Four at the very start of his career, which stands greater than ever today, like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally.Spider-Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member, trusting them so much that he would reveal his identity to them. Of the two previously mentioned teams, Spidey is closest to the Human Torch, playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively, and Wolverine, respectively. Peter is also quite close to the X-Men, able to sympathize with the public scorn that mutants often face,<sup>[351]</sup> and once joining their faculty - though he was quick to call them out on being prejudicial against non-mutants. Spider-Man has also developed a strong friendship with Deadpool, despite annoying each other with their morals and jokes.</p><p>Personal Data</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Hazel</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Brown</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Forest Hills, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Education:</b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/richard-parker/4005-15261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\">Richard Parker</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"/mary-parker/4005-15262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\">Mary Parker</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Benjamin Parker</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker</a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"/amy-reilly/4005-65796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65796\">Amy Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/amanda-reilly/4005-66173/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66173\">Amanda Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/alexa-reilly/4005-65797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65797\">Alexa Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Benjamin Reilly</a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> (clone), <a href=\"/spidercide/4005-25666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide</a> (clone).</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5145454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea Tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.</p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.</p><h3>Spider-Sense</h3><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone-based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"/michele-gonzales/4005-62208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62208\">Michele Gonzales</a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course, his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired, or when he chooses to ignore it although it's difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn't very effective due to Spidey's previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.</p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a height of much greater than three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a>, and <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. It's also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus's nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces fewer fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man's best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid-fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn't have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.</p><h3>Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility, and Reflexes</h3><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility, and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine-gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable to react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outrun speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference for Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance, and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balancing in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil, and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point-blank range after the bullet had been fired.</p><h3>Superhuman Durability</h3><p>Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super-powered individuals. For example, he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin, etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr. Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline, he tanked a building destroying explosion but was significantly weakened afterward. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man's body \"as being as hard as concrete\".</p><p>However, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet that pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, his healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.</p><h3>Wall Crawling</h3><p>Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New York but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.</p><h3>Organic Webbing</h3><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long-lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider-Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider-Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.</p><h3>Superhuman Stamina</h3><p>Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.</p><h3>Regenerative Healing Factor</h3><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however, after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino but was fine in the next issue.</p><h3>Foreign Chemical Resistance</h3><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.</p><h3>Superhuman Sight</h3><p>Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense. Perhaps most impressively, during Spider-Island, a depowered Hercules with Spider-Man's power-set said he could see bullets in slow motion.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>On top of his spider-given powers, Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology, and physics. This has become particularly apparent during his time working at Horizon Labs, where he was able to create a device to drain Alpha of his powers in less than 24 hours.</p><p>He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat over the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man's reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.</p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider-sense. He began training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called the \"Way of the Spider\". It was then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists of among other things, hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed. This new martial art has considerably improved Spider-Man's H2H capabilities, and so far he has stalemated Julia Carpenter and effortlessly defeated 3 spider-powered individuals in a few seconds during Spider-Island. When he regained his Spider-Sense, he defeated a mutated Kaine who was considerably stronger and quicker than him and effortlessly trumped a mind-controlled Spider-Woman, in a handful of blows and kicks.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h3>Web-Shooters</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2269938650307\" data-width=\"326\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 326px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\"><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's web-shooters broken down</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man's most famous piece of equipment is his self-built <a href=\"/web-shooters/4055-42426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\">web-shooters</a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter's own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man's primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.</p><h3>Utility Belt</h3><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"../../spider-signal/18-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Signal</a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera, and his mask when not in costume.</p><h3>Camera</h3><p>Spider-Man possesses his father's automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man's chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/65-40822/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Daily Bugle</a>.</p><h3>Spider-Tracer</h3><p>The <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Tracer</a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100-mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.</p><h3>Mask</h3><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man's colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.</p><h3>Spider-Mobile</h3><p>The <a href=\"/spider-mobile/4055-15441/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile</a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer</a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.</p><h3>Equipment since working at Horizon Labs</h3><p>At Horizons Labs, the combination of a well-paying job and access to numerous tech has allowed Peter to expand on the equipment he uses. So far he has developed a Spider-Glider, Thermodynamic Foam, Cryo Pellets, voice-activated web-shooters, and various types of webbing, including magnetic and acidic variants. Many of the equipment have a usage in day-to-day usage as well- for example, the cryo pellet technology was used to help keep organs and limbs viable for longer periods of time. The Thermodynamic foam also has used in the stopping and prevention of fires.</p><h3>Spider-bots</h3><p>Dock ock created specific spectators who keep watch of new york, saving spider-mans the trouble to patrol.</p><h2>Costumes</h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well-known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume, and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man's costumes in his costume gallery.</p><p>It is Spider-Man's original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man's essential traits. During Spidey's early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrunk and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.</p><h3>Black Suit</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it, he had an unlimited supply of webbing, and the suit could mimic his civilian clothing. It didn't, contrary to popular belief, enhance his powers. After meeting with Mr. Fantastic, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"/kravens-last-hunt/4045-43327/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43327\">Kraven's last Hunt</a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man's heart like never before. He wore the black costume to show this dark side, becoming much more ruthless towards enemies (using torture for example). Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter's \"brother\" Kaine. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-40598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Arana</a>.

It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small-caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he's worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice-activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while. He had already known about this and used his computer expertise to disable the override and managed to defeat Iron Man with a surprise attack. He then discarded the costume and returned to wear his original costume when he joined Captain America's team during the Civil War. The members of the initiative team known as the <a href=\"../../scarlet-spiders/65-44648/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scarlet Spiders</a> would start wearing costumes of similar design and functions.</p><h3>Spider Armor</h3><p><b>See: <a href=\"/spider-armor/4055-57037/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57037\">Spider-Armor</a></b></p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.3493449781659\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\"><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spiderman armor</figcaption></figure><p>While in an ESU laboratory, Peter invented a white &amp; blue suit that was made of steel plates that were from a pseudo-metallic composition using a modified webbing formula.

He also created special lenses so that he can be seen by people if needs be. The lighting on the suit can change between green, orange, and blue. Orange is for the secondary mode which disrupts sonic frequencies from infrasonic to ultrasonic but is visible. Blue is in normal mode which can be seen and heard. However, a side effect of this costume is that while he can be impervious to sonic attacks, it also prevents him from hearing others. For example, while fighting the Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, Spider-Man was unable to hear the Cat's cries for help.</p><h3>Future Foundation Costume</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.4148471615721\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:241.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\"><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation</figcaption></figure><p>When Peter joined The Future Foundation he was given a new costume by <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Sue Storm</a>.

This was used when Peter Parker's counterpart was badly wounded and needed Peter, Amazing Spider-Man, to fight crime in New York for a short time while Peter, the Amazing Spider, healed up. In the end, Peter Parker found out that his counterpart was actually draining the abilities of other Spider-Men and soon took the permanent role as the Amazing Spider.</p><h3>The Sinister Six Armor</h3><p><strong>See: <a href=\"/spider-armor-mk-iii/4055-59586/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-59586\">Spider-Armor MK III</a></strong></p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2550504\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2854251012146\" data-width=\"988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2550504\"><img alt=\"Spidey's Sinister Six armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-width=\"497\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 746w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 497w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's Sinister Six armor\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 746w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118094/2550504-2256236_spider_man4.jpg 497w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" data-width=\"497\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's Sinister Six armor</figcaption></figure><p>During the recent <a href=\"/ends-of-the-earth/4045-56782/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56782\">Ends of the Earth</a> Storyline, Spider-Man wore a new suit of armor designed to counter the abilities of the <a href=\"/sinister-six/4060-40429/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40429\">Sinister Six.</a> It provided him with extra physical protection to withstand hits more blows from <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">The Rhino</a> as well as an immunity to <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>'s Attacks.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC on September 9, 1967, and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City university, while witnessing a radiology experiment that would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider's leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter's first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had run past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn't really care at the time and didn't help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben's death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle's murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime-fighter protecting New York.</p><p>Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson.</p><p>This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there's a hang-up, you'll find the Spider-Man!\"</p><h4>Spider-Man (1978)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.96333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\"><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Japanese Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel's famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Japan</a>.

This was the second animated production of Spider-Man after its original series that started in 1967. This series was produced by the newly formed Marvel Productions, having risen from the ashes of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The company that had produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series. This version's character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"../../john-romita/26-7499/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Romita</a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid-60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a college student who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as Peter's Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson's secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"../../robbie-robertson/29-1782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Robbie Robertson</a>, Jameson's assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and the Chameleon. This also included a six-part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.</p><h4><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends </a>(1981)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981, and lasted through September 10, 1983. This would be the third animated adventure for Spidey which would end up being more popular than its previous series Spider-Man, which ended the same year this new show would start. After Spider-Man in 1981, NBC wanted to take Spider-Man on a different route that would appeal to more audiences. In this series, Marvel adds <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow \">X-Men's</a> Iceman and adds a new superhero named <a href=\"../../firestar/29-2101/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Firestar</a>. She gave Peter Parker a room that turned into a secret superhero hi-tech headquarters. This would change the title of the show to Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends. This series would add new villains only for this show and also have superhero team-ups throughout the series. They would fight some old enemies such as Doctor Octopus, <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scorpion</a>, Green Goblin, Kraven the Hunter, <a href=\"../../swarm/29-1945/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Swarm</a>, Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Kingpin of Crime, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shocker</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sandman</a>, <a href=\"../../beetle/29-4836/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beetle</a>, and other Marvel enemies such as Doctor Doom, Magneto, <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Loki</a>, <a href=\"../../mordred/29-19961/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mordred</a>, the Red Skull, and the <a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Juggernaut</a>. The Spider-Friends would also team-up with superheroes such as <a href=\"../../sunfire/29-3175/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sunfire</a>, Captain America, <a href=\"../../shanna/29-4579/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shanna the She-Devil</a>, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Namor the Submariner</a>, Doctor Strange, <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Hulk</a>, Thor, the third <a href=\"../../black-knight/29-3172/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Black Knight</a>, and the X-Men. For the second season of this show the title would be changed to \"The Incredible Hulk And The Amazing Spider-Man.\" This second would be for an hour show that would feature 30 minutes of Spidey and friends and 30 minutes of Hulk. The third season of this show would then be reversed to \"The Amazing Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.\" This would be the last season and would also still revolve around Spider-Man and his friends.

The cartoon revolved around a 19-year-old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire State University. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy/Black Cat and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much-anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.68181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water-based and was made for <a href=\"../../hydro-man/29-4457/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hydro-Man</a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Madame Webb</a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel's popular superhero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him, however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world. He is astounded at the fact of being an international symbol in our world, and before he leaves, he meets with the man who created him, Stan Lee.</p><h4><a href=\"/spiderman-unlimited/4075-128/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-128\">Spider-Man Unlimited </a>(1999)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.805\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man Unlimited</figcaption></figure><p>This series debuted on Fox on October 2, 1999, and lasted through March 31, 2001. Spider-Man, in this series, was voiced by Rino Romano (making him the only voice actor to play both Spider-Man and Batman, the most-recognized characters from both DC and Marvel). This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ's son, <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man-made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \"<a href=\"/counter-earth/4020-54572/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter Earth</a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take-off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nick Fury</a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson.</p><p>Once on \"Counter Earth\", after almost being burned up on entry, Peter is under arrest and is sought out by <a href=\"../../lord-tyger/29-23429/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lord Tyger</a> and the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary</a>.

While being chased throughout the city, he realizes that there is a high-tech society where humanoid animals have taken over and the normal people live in the overpopulated slums. He was captured and told of what happened by the High Evolutionary who came from another planet to seek a place where petty humans squabbles; greed, selfishness, violence, and hatred was no more. He built his paradise with many experiments, using animals that he now calls Beastials. They are under the leadership of the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary</a>, are stronger, faster, and free of the primitive human mind. Spider-Man was rescued by the resistance who had been told that the war lasted for 50 years. Spidey finds John in the resistance deciding to stay until the humans are free of the High Evolutionary's oppression. Peter blends in with the humans to see what the \"Counter Earth\" world was like. After saving Shane Yamada-Jones from the robots, Naoko, Shane's mother, a doctor, helps Peter. He takes him into their home, providing Peter pays rent, giving him two weeks rent free for saving Shane's life. This series doesn't last long.

This series is supposed to be like the 1960's version of Spider-Man. It doesn't start off like all of the other incarnations of Spider-Man, starting off with Peter getting bitten by a radioactive spider but with a twist. Peter just starts his junior year of high school and gets pushed around by jocks. He made friends in Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy is also Peters's intellectual equal, getting a job working for Doctor Connors.

The game involves climbing a skyscraper, rescuing hostages, and defusing bombs set by the Green Goblin. The 1990s saw a flood of Spider-Man Video Games. The first game of the decade released was <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b>, a puzzle action game released for Amiga, PC: DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b> was released in 1990 for the Game Boy.

Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original storylines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Maximum Carnage</a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety</b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire</b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of the rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. However, in 1995 he made his fighting game debut in Capcom's<strong> Marvel Super Heroes</strong> arcade game (which was later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn). He returned for the 1997 sequel <strong>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</strong> (which later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn) and its 1998 followup, <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes </strong>(which was later ported to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\" data-ratio=\"0.69849246231156\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 597px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\"><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2</figcaption></figure><p>Not until 2000 would Spider-Man return in his own game. Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, as a character in a fighting game and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man</b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>Spider-Man</b>, developed by Neversoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year but lacked the full motion cut scenes due to the hardware of the system. Spider-Man was also one of the playable characters in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes </strong>(which later was released on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Xbox). In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</b> as a hidden character. In 2001, sequels to the successful Activision titles were released. <b>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</b> for the PlayStation and <b>Spider-Man 2: Sinister Six</b> for the Gameboy Color. Spider-Man made an early appearance on Nintendo's new handheld system, the Gameboy Advance with <b>Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace</b>.

It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox, and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"../../spider-man-2/223-42/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 2</a> was released in June 2004, <strong>Spider-Man 2: The Game</strong> was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic-related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>Ultimate Spider-Man</b> followed many of the comic story arcs and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</strong> and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dum Dum Dugan</a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A.I.M</a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider, and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man's latest film, <a href=\"../../spider-man-3/223-54/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 3</a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3</b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP, and PC. <strong>Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</strong> was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2, PC, PSP, and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.</p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey's Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player's can dictate Spider-Man's actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Luke Cage</a>, Mary Jane, and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</strong> and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.</p><p>Spidey's next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in the first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing are crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin, and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end, you battle an immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\"><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey in action</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man once again featured as a playable fighter in the 2011 release of <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</strong> and its updated release of <strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</strong> and versions of the game would be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360. October 2011 also saw the release of the next Spider-Man video game adventure with <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time</b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free rein after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O'Hara. A new villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter's death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple dangers, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex. Currently, Beenox has been given rights to the creation of all future Spider-Man games.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.94272727272727\" data-width=\"1100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man is an unlockable character in the Facebook game <b>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</b>.
