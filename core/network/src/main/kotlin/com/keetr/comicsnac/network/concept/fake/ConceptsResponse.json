When they go there, they tell the fire people that they have come to learn the undiscovered. <a href=\"/odin/4005-3507/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3507\">Odin</a> asks Surtur if it's true that he would one day destroy the nine worlds. Surtur answers him yes and explains how he shall do it using his <a href=\"/sword-of-doom/4055-48502/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-48502\">Sword Of Doom</a> and the <a href=\"/eternal-flame/4055-56058/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56058\">Eternal flame</a>. Odin remarks back \"Wouldn't it be better if the flame was taken out and the sword broken?\". Surtur then returns saying \"The flame cannot be extinguished but they could try to break his sword\". Surtur would then slam his fist on the ground as demons started to come from all corners. Then the brothers Vili and Ve would summon the raging storms of the arctic to stop the demons. It worked and started to freeze them.</p><p>Next the three brothers joined into one to battle Surtur. As the battle continued, they discovered they weren't able to best Surtur, so they made one final blow which broke Surtur's sword. Vili one of the brothers states it to be a victory while Odin simply says that he will come after them. Ve then would cut down the flame of destruction so that even if Surtur were to reforge his sword he could not kindle it with the flame so that the world wouldn't end. Odin then starts to run to the portal to the nine worlds then releases his brothers who aren't following. One of the brothers says that if they go Surtur shall follow, then suddenly as Surtur emerges from the brimstone lake, a blast would come knocking Odin out of the realm Muspelheim and knocked him out as well. When he had awoken, the entrance to the realm was gone and he had the combined powers of his two brothers, as well as his own, which created the Odin Force; however, he was aware that his brothers were dead.</p><h2>Fe<b>ats</b></h2><ol><li>Assisted <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> in denting <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>'s virtually indestructible <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">shield</a>.</li><li>Odin, wielding it, created a galaxy and then destroyed it.</li><li>With The Odin Force, Thor takes two nuclear warheads out of his chest without injury.</li><li>Killed Captain America whilst destroying his shield.</li><li>Kills <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> while destroying him and his <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">Adamantium</a> bones.</li><li>Thor has used the Odin Force to cure a man of his terminal cancer.</li><li>Thor has used the Odin Force to stop time itself.</li><li>Odin used it to cut out the heart of a star, which was used to forge and empower the legendary hammer Mjolnir.</li><li>Odin used it to bring back to life both Thor and Brunnhilde.

They are also used to narrate other sides of a character that may not be possible in the main story arc.</p><p>An alternate universe is also referred as an alternate time-line, or alternate future. The alternate futures are possible futures which could happen depending on the actions of the past. However, these futures may actually be separate universes in a what-if scenario.</p><p>The <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/4015-56051/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56051\">Age of Apocalypse</a> is an example of an alternate universe where Professor <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Xavier</a> was accidentally killed by his own son, <a href=\"/legion/4005-13349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13349\">Legion</a> when he went back in time to kill Magneto. As a result, <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a> ruled this altered timeline in which Xavier had never founded the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>Alternate Universes are generally very short lived and often created to demonstrate a 'what if' scenario. The Marvel <a href=\"/what-if/4050-4249/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-4249\">What If?</a> volumes as well as the <a href=\"/marvel-zombies/4045-40611/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40611\">Marvel Zombies</a> are a good example of this. The comics describing the alternate universes are usually short, and after they are narrated, they disappear.</p><p>Alternate universe was also shown on the TV series called <a href=\"/sliders/4060-58078/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-58078\">Sliders</a> where the four sliders travel to each parallel <a href=\"/earth/4020-57183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57183\">Earth</a>. These parallel Earths have their own alternate histories which would lead to the present day changes. However, the time travel wasn't involved in creating these alternate universes.</p><p>A Parallel Universe is more of a static. An example of this may be an 'opposite' universe, in which the good guys are the bad guys, and the bad guys the good guys. Parallel Universes may be described in mini-arcs, or they may only exist in another Alternate Universe.</p><p>Leading up to the year 2000 <a href=\"/chaos-comics/4010-1864/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1864\">Chaos! Comics</a> devised a 2 year story arc for all its characters where by all the story-lines of the main characters converged around a single story thread that culminated int he total destruction of their universe. In the year 2000 the Chaos Comics universe was remade by a single character who devised 8 worlds and placed each of the main characters into these worlds, reborn for their stories to continue afresh.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Mutants mark the next step in human evolution, commonly referred to as <i>Homo Superior</i>. Unlike other superhuman powers, mutation originates at conception as a result of the presence of a particular gene known as the X-Gene (a.k.a. the X-Factor or mutant gene). Mutant powers generally manifest around puberty, but can be catalyzed during periods of heightened emotional or physical stress. Often times, some superhumans are erroneously referred to as mutants because of unique genetic structure and/or their powers were evident at birth. <b>The only true Marvel Mutants are those born with an X-Gene</b>.</p><p>The X-Gene commonly lies dormant until puberty, when it manifests in a number of ways, but it can manifest at birth or lie dormant throughout life, or until triggered mechanically. Mutations manifest in varied and unexpected ways, and mutants may or may not look different than normal humans. A mutation will grant a member of the homo superior species either a <b>psionic</b> or <b>physical</b> ability or some combination thereof. Variations in <i>appearance</i> include abnormal body color, excessive hair or fur, disproportionate or additional limbs, extra appendages (such as tails, wings, or tentacles), textured skin (such as rock or scales) or an animal-like appearance. Powers vary in nature and and include (but are not limited to) superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman senses, flight, telepathy, telekinesis, blast powers, shape shifting, mastery over particular energies/radiation, and control over particular elements.</p><p>Among the public, some humans show great fear or hatred towards mutants due to either their abilities, their appearance, or ignorance, but there are mutants (and humans) who make an effort to achieve equality among humans and mutants, but some feel that the humans will never change and will continue to oppress mutantkind.</p><p>There have been many attempts to neutralize the X-gene for those who wish to lead to what they feel is a normal life. Some have been successful, some have not.</p><h3>Marvel's First Mutant</h3><p><a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a> is often labeled as Marvel's first mutant, which is true insofar as he is the first mutant character published by Marvel.</p><p>However, the first, as in oldest known mutant in the Marvel universe, would be <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a>, being well over 17,000 years old.</p><h4>Chronological list of Marvel mutants:</h4><ul><li>Selene (over 17,000 years old)</li><li>Forever Man (?)</li><li>Saul (one of the oldest Externals)</li><li>Crule (worshiped Hyborian dieties)</li><li>Nicodemus (~10000 years old)</li><li>White Sword</li><li>Apocalypse (born 3000 BC.)</li><li>Genesis (wife of Apocalypse)</li><li>Isca the Unbeaten (sister of Genesis)</li><li>First Horsemen (children of Apocalypse and Genesis)</li><li>Azazel (several thousands years old)</li><li>Sphinx (at least 3300 years old)</li><li>War (Final Horsemen) (born in the 3rd century)</li><li>Death (Final Horsemen) (born in the 4th century)</li><li>Candra (over 1000 years old)</li><li>Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (11th century)</li><li>Sahreed (active when Exodus' powers manifested)</li><li>Scarab (active when Exodus' powers manifested)</li><li>Exodus (born in the 12th century)</li><li>Damian Tryp (born in 1337)</li><li>Locomotive Breath</li><li>Gideon (born in the 15th century)</li><li>William Burke</li><li>Shadow King (born in the 16th century)</li><li>Gloria Knoblach (born 1673)</li><li>Clarity (born 1675)</li><li>Dark Mother (born 1680)</li><li>Summoner (~300 years old)</li><li>Elias Bogan (over 250 years old)</li><li>Graymalkin (born before 1775)</li><li>Pestilence (Final Horsemen) (born in ~1800)</li><li>Famine (Final Horsemen) (born in ~1800)</li><li>Cyber (born in ~1800)</li><li>Absalom (over 150 years old)</li><li>Mr. Sinister (Artificial mutant, born in mid 19th century.)</li><li>Margaret Slade (born in the 1850's)</li><li>Kabar Brashir (born in the 1850's)</li><li>Tobias Messenger (born in 1859)</li><li>Black Womb (born in the 1870's)</li><li>Hamilton Slade (born in the 1870-1880's)</li><li>Frederick Slade (born in the 1870-1880's)</li><li>Jack Starsmore (born in the 1870-1880's)</li><li>Sabretooth (over 130 years old)</li><li>Destiny (over 130 years old)</li><li>Mystique (over 130 years old)</li><li>Gateway</li><li>Klara Prast (born in 1895)</li><li>Wolverine (born in the 1890's)</li><li>Silver Fox</li><li>Centennial (born in 1902)</li><li>Dr. Nemesis (born in 1906)</li><li>Spitfire (born in the 1910s)</li><li>Namor (born in 1920)</li><li>Namora (born in 1921)</li><li>Magneto (born in the 1920s)</li><li>Whizzer (born in the 1920s)</li><li>Super-Sabre</li><li>Crimson Commando</li><li>Stonewall</li><li>Solem</li><li>Spider-Queen</li><li>Toro</li><li>Scalphunter</li></ul><h2>Omega-Level Mutants</h2><p>Omega-level mutants are the most powerful members of the mutant race, with their psionic powers unlimited within the spectrum of their specific field.</p><p>The Omega-Level Mutation term was originally used to label mutants that were the biggest threat. Omega-Level Mutants are now known as mutants with potential for immeasurable power. The theory of the omega-level power was explained in the limited series <a href=\"/x-men-forever/4050-26670/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-26670\">X-Men: Forever</a>.</p><p>It explained current human population in the Marvel Universe are the result of experiments by the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a> eons ago. They were attempting to create humanity and have them evolve into new beings. Those that have achieved Omega-Level powers are nearing the final stage of evolution and often pass along this trait to their progeny.</p><p>The most common listing of qualities needed by these mutants is that they must have unlimited potential, be able to utterly control a substance (examples include ice, matter and energy) and that they can live beyond their physical form. However another way they can be judged to be Omega-level is if they are capable of hosting the Phoenix Force. Be aware, all these are speculations; there are no actual rules for what being an Omega means.</p><h4>The confirmed Omega-level mutants that are cited below include:</h4><ol><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/rachel-grey/4005-3566/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3566\">Rachel Summers</a> was the first mutant referred to as omega-level in Uncanny X-Men #208.</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/mr-m/4005-40602/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40602\">Mr. M</a> shows spectacular displays of power throughout his few appearances but in is in X-Men: The 198 #2 that Val Cooper tells the X-Men that he is indeed an Omega-level mutant.

Each Ultra Sapien has a biogenetic mark somewhere on their body that looks like a tattoo, but other than that most of them look like normal humans. These Ultras belonged to America and were kept secret and under control for years until some of the Ultra Sapiens got together and destroyed the project so all the superhumans could escape. The now-free and untraceable Ultras spread around the world to live their own lives. Some became mercenaries or superheroes while others just hid and tried to have normal lives.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Power Cosmic is a limitless energy that can allow the user to do many things, such as resurrect the dead, manipulate the user's size and mass, teleportation, telepathy, creation of force fields, time-travel, superhuman strength, immortality, and much more. The Power Cosmic can be used in a powerful blast or in small doses, such as changing the color of a plant. The Power Cosmic can also be infused into the human soul, giving them a portion of the Powers of the Universe.</p><p>The greatest and most powerful wielder (and perhaps source) of the Power Cosmic would be <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/galactus/4005-2149/\">Galactus</a>, the Devourer of Worlds. He is rumored to be able to teleport entire galaxies throughout time and space, re-shape worlds that have been destroyed back to their original form in every detail, and even create life. Galactus often bestows a small fraction of the Power Cosmic to his <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/heralds-of-galactus/4060-40462/\">Heralds</a>, most notably the Silver Surfer, who has used it to strip mutants of their abilities (either temporarily or permanently), and more. Galactus, however, can bestow or take away the Power Cosmic at will.</p><p>With the Power Cosmic comes a Cosmic Sense. It allows anyone imbued with the Power Cosmic to be one with the processes of the universe. The <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> once described it as being able to \"hear the cosmic static of the universe's electromagnetic fields and detect the pain of dying stars or the rhapsody of planets aborning\".</p><p>The Power Cosmic originates from the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/astral-plane/4020-54190/\">Astral Plane</a>.</p><h3>The Old Power</h3><p>The <a href=\"/old-power/4015-55874/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55874\">Old Power</a> is an attempt by the Shadow Priests to recreate the Power Cosmic. This was only partially successful, as the Old Power is unstable.</p><h2><b>Wielders of the Power Cosmic</b></h2><p><span>Galactus is the bestower of the Power Cosmic and seems to be the only living source of said energy. He can manipulate every organism. His hunger is insatiable, and the only way to sate his hunger is to consume the core of living planets, thus devouring the chosen world.</span></p><h3><b>Given by Galactus</b></h3><p><a href=\"/galacta/4005-59459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59459\">Galacta</a>: Galacta is Galactus' biological daughter and, like both her Father and Tyrant, she is one of the most powerful wielders of The Power Cosmic in existence. But unlike Galactus and Tyrant, she never uses her powers to harm anything other than alien infestations both microscopic and macroscopic in origin. The reason she does this is to keep her adopted home world, Earth, and it's inhabitants safe.</p><p><a href=\"/tyrant/4005-7123/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7123\">Tyrant</a>: Tyrant has been called Galactus' \"son\" and was bestowed a much greater amount of the Power Cosmic than any other herald. After a conflict with Galactus, he was reduced in power but still has shown to be stronger than any other herald.</p><p><a href=\"/silver-surfer/4005-2502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2502\">Silver Surfer</a>: Norrin Radd is the best known Herald of Galactus. The Power Cosmic has granted him such abilities as superhuman strength, immortality, cosmic awareness, energy and molecular manipulation as well as the ability to fly faster than the speed of light.</p><p><a href=\"/air-walker/4005-7126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7126\">Air-Walker</a>: The original Air-Walker, Gabriel Lan, was much favored by Galactus. The android that replaced him after he gave his life for Galactus was not favored as much because he did not share the same passion as the original. The original Air-Walker was given superhuman strength and durability, as well as an immunity to the vacuum of space by the Power Cosmic.</p><p><a href=\"/firelord/4005-7108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\">Firelord</a>: Pyreus Kril was yet another Herald of Galactus and also friend of Air-Walker. The Power Cosmic bestowed upon him the power of flight, superhuman strength and the ability to channel cosmic flame.</p><p><a href=\"/terrax/4005-2106/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2106\">Terrax</a>: The Herald known as Terrax the Tamer was gifted with superhuman strength, stamina, durability and reflexes, superluminal flight, blast power and the ability to manipulate earth.</p><p><a href=\"/frankie-raye/4005-11605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11605\">Nova</a>: Frankie Raye of Earth volunteered to serve a weakened Galactus and was only given a minimal amount of the Power Cosmic due to his depleted state.</p><p><a href=\"/morg/4005-7122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7122\">Morg</a>: Morg the Executioner was endowed with the Power Cosmic, and from this was given superhuman strength and the ability to channel energy through his axe.</p><p><a href=\"/red-shift/4005-40878/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40878\">Red Shift</a>: Red Shift also received the Power Cosmic from Galactus. He was made to be superhumanly strong and durable, immune to the vacuum of space, has the ability to open dimensional rifts and generate swords supplied with cosmic power.</p><p><a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a>: When Johnny Storm was temporarily imbued with the Power Cosmic he gained the ability to understand absolutely anything he analyzed.</p><p><a href=\"/alpha-ray/4005-40974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40974\">Alpha Ray</a>: A biomechanical being Galactus infused with the Power Cosmic.</p><p><a href=\"/plasma/4005-11596/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11596\">Plasma</a>: Herald of Galactus in the <a href=\"/heroes-reborn/4045-55955/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55955\">Heroes Reborn</a> world.</p><p><a href=\"/stardust/4005-7491/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7491\">Stardust</a>: Lambda-Zero was given the Power Cosmic by Galactus resulting in the power to manipulate cosmic energy in addition to its already formidable natural powers.</p><p><a href=\"/praeter/4005-80329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80329\">Praeter</a>: Christian Pastor from Oklahoma, called Pastor Mike, and newest herald of Galactus. So far, he has shown the powers of Super Speed, Flight, and Tracking.</p><p><a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>: At one point, Galactus made Superman his Herald, removing his cape and sheathing him in gold. With the Power Cosmic Superman's natural powers were enhanced by a great degree, including space travel. A host of new powers were also granted to him including firing powerful energy blasts, teleportation, unleashing a blast from his whole body - which was used to blast <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> off of him, cosmic awareness, and probably a whole host of other abilities which were never revealed due to him betraying Galactus. However, when Superman did have the Power Cosmic, Galactus said that he was his most powerful Herald ever. (see: Superman/Fantastic Four #1)</p><p><a href=\"/cosmic-hulk/4005-68919/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-68919\">Cosmic Hulk</a>: This version of the Hulk is a robot created by the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/4005-2131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2131\">Mad Thinker</a>. Once, instead of having heralds, Galactus had a data loop program that wandered the universe, compelling beings to create artificial life forms that would one day help Galactus consume their planet.</p><h3>Given by Silver Surfer</h3><p><a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">Captain Universe</a>: The Silver Surfer permanently infused a portion of The Power Cosmic into the <a href=\"/uni-power/4015-44362/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44362\">Uni-Power</a> and repaired both its severe memory loss and power fluctuations.</p><p><a href=\"/shalla-bal/4005-7125/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7125\">Shalla Bal</a>: She was granted a portion of the Silver Surfer's power. She has the ablity to grow life wherever she steps. She can also call out to the Surfer for assistance through her thoughts.</p><p><a href=\"/silver-skyriders/4060-56736/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56736\">Silver Skyriders</a>: In another universe, twelve pieces of the Silver Surfer bestowed his power on twelve aliens forming the Silver Skyriders.</p><p><a href=\"/skaar/4005-48518/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48518\">Skaar</a>: Silver Surfer wished to show Skaar what it was like when a mortal reaches for the power of the Gods, so he shows him the Power Cosmic by fusing with him. The Silver Surfer then talks to Skaar about decisions that would change his life forever, but Skaar has a different point of view.</p><p><a href=\"/earl-weygand/4005-64821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64821\">Earl Weygand</a>: The Silver Surfer gave half of his Power Cosmic to Earl in order to help him defeat the <a href=\"/enslavers/4060-56863/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56863\">Enslavers</a>. This turned Earl into a Silver Surfer himself. He was able to destroy the power supply of the ship, but it cost him his life.</p><h3>Taken from a wielder</h3><p><a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>: Victor Von Doom did for a time steal the Power Cosmic from the Silver Surfer. He eventually had the power stripped from him by Galactus.</p><p><a href=\"/doombots/4005-11924/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11924\">Doombot</a>: A robotic creation of Doctor Doom sent to absorb the Power Cosmic for himself once again. It was able to get the power but was destroyed.</p><p><a href=\"/red-hulk/4005-56974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56974\">Red Hulk:</a> In battle with the Silver Surfer, the Red Hulk strangles him and before the Surfer could stop him, the Red Hulk absorbed every inch of the Power Cosmic into his body and kills the Silver Surfer. He then takes Terrax's axe and the Silver Surfers board but Galactus once again defeats Rulk. Grandmaster resurrects all of those killed by Rulk, including the Silver Surfer.</p><p><a href=\"/cosmic-messiah/4005-64828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64828\">Cosmic Messiah</a>: The Cosmic Messiah was created by using a combination of the <a href=\"/puppet-master/4005-3799/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3799\">Puppet Master's</a> radioactive clay and the Power Cosmic siphoned from the Silver Surfer by the <a href=\"/gangers/4060-56849/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56849\">Gangers</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a>: Ambushing the Silver Surfer on Earth, the High Evolutionary completely siphoned the Power Cosmic from the Silver Surfer, leaving him a mortal being again. Wyndam did not absorb all of the Power Cosmic into himself, but instead, used it as needed and took control of one of Galactus' <a href=\"/galactus-ship/4055-55839/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55839\">Star Spheres</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/horacio-de-la-fuente/4005-78549/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-78549\">Horacio de la Fuente</a> - A dying man given the Power Cosmic by the High Evolutionary.</p><p><a href=\"/suzi-endo/4005-14223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14223\">Suzi Endo</a>: Suzi (also known as Cybermancer) was made Herald to the High Evolutionary and changed with the Power Cosmic, much like the Silver Surfer did. She would come to be known as the Seeker.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Heroes Reborn</b></p><p>In the <a href=\"/heroes-reborn/4045-55955/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55955\">Heroes Reborn</a> world, the cosmic rays that gave the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> their powers were actually part of the Power Cosmic.

A Corps member is equipped with an item that is regarded as one of the most powerful weapons in the <a href=\"/dc-universe/4015-40391/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40391\">DC Universe</a>, called a <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Power Ring</a>. The Power Ring enables its bearer to manifest their thoughts into hard-light constructs and other various properties only limited by the ring's amount of power and the user's willpower and imagination. It chooses the individual and successor attributed to overcoming the great fear through the might of willpower. The Power Ring is based on advanced technology rather than having its power magically derived, as of the one of <a href=\"/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\">Alan Scott</a>.</p><p>The ring is primarily used for anti-gravity, to unleash torrents of energy, translate alien dialects and to create hard-light constructs of any shape or complexity.

Hal stands alongside the greatest Green Lanterns in the DC Universe, as he's one of the few to have led out courageous duties that have put a great impact into saving the world. However, due to his rebellious doings and partnering up with other ring-bearers of various emotional spectrums, the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe</a> now believe he's one of the most dangerous of any Green Lantern. He has since been removed from the corps and is now wielding a green power ring created by <a href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\">Thaal Sinestro</a>.</p><h3>John Stewart</h3><p><a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a>, a former <a href=\"/united-states-marine-corps/4060-44416/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44416\">Marine</a> sharpshooter was chosen to become the next Green Lantern of Earth after Hal Jordan gave up his position and <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> was injured. He is currently one of the Lanterns protecting <a href=\"/space-sector-2814/4020-54944/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54944\">Space Sector 2814</a> and a member of the <a href=\"/honor-guard/4060-59122/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59122\">Honor Guard</a> in the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a>.</p><h3>Guy Gardner</h3><p>When Abin Sur's spaceship crash-landed on Earth his power ring logged <a href=\"/guy-gardner/4005-1791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1791\">Guy Gardner</a> as a \"backup\" Green Lantern of Earth having been farther away from the crash site then Hal Jordan was. Guy is the more arrogant of the humans and became a full-fledged Green Lantern after John Stewart.

He was once the last existing Green Lantern and the main factor into rebuilding both the Corps and <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians of the Universe</a>. For a short time he played the role of <a href=\"/ion/4015-55697/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55697\">Ion</a>, but has since became <a href=\"/honor-guard/4060-59122/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59122\">Honor Guard</a> of the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a>.

The Green Power Ring is able to perform a number of abilities which can be found here: <a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Power Ring</a>.</p><h2><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/retcon/4015-43566/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43566\"><b>Retconned</b></a></h2><p><b>Radiation:</b> Besides light-based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a href=\"/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.</p><p><b><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/time-travel/4015-55712/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55712\">Time travel</a>:</b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p><b>Mental Incapacitation</b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.</p><p><b>Yellow Impurity:</b> In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to face the greatest of fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overpowered.</p><p><b>Recharge</b>: The Ring previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring directly at the light. However, the power ring now only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy. Sinestro stated to Hal that it was possible for a Green Lantern to store his/her battery in a Pocket Universe and take it with them wherever they went, but so far Hal has not displayed the ability to do this.</p><p><b>Red Lantern Corps</b>. Bearers of the <a href=\"/red-power-ring/4055-55723/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55723\">Red Power Ring</a> have the ability to drain a Green Power Ring of its energy. The ring of a Blue Lantern, however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect. Blue Lanterns rings also have the ability to purge the negative effects that a Red Lanterns Ring can cause upon the wielder of a Green Lantern Ring.</p><p><b>(Previous Weaknesses)</b></p><p><b>Ability to Kill</b>: One of the main weaknesses of the Power Rings, that greatly disturbed Sinestro, was the fact that the bearers of the Green Lantern Ring were unable to kill. Recently however, this restriction on the rings has been lifted, but murder is still against the law of the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">GL Corps</a><b>. </b>This restriction was overthrown by the Guardians of the Universe during the Sinestro Corps War, in the time of desperation.</p><h2>Related Articles</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lantern Corps</a></li><li><a href=\"/green-power-ring/4055-41361/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41361\">Green Power Ring</a></li><li><a href=\"/power-battery/4055-55747/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55747\">Green Power Battery</a></li><li><a href=\"/central-power-battery/4055-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55704\">Central Power Battery</a></li><li><a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/4060-9057/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9057\">Guardians Of The Universe</a></li><li><a href=\"/emotional-spectrum/4015-49955/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-49955\">Emotional Spectrum</a></li><li><a href=\"/3600-sectors-of-space/4020-56427/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56427\">3600 Space Sector</a></li><li><a href=\"/space-sector-2814/4020-54944/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54944\">Space Sector 2814</a></li><li><a href=\"/ganthets-tale/4050-22313/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22313\">Ganthet's Tale</a></li><li><a href=\"/ion/4015-55697/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55697\">Ion</a></li><li><a href=\"/parallax/4005-41293/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41293\">Parallax</a></li><li><a href=\"/sinestro-corps/4060-42352/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42352\">Sinestro Corps</a></li><li><a href=\"/sinestro/4005-10448/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10448\">Sinestro</a></li><li><a href=\"/sinestro-corps-war/4045-50650/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-50650\">Sinestro Corps War</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-blackest-night/4045-55766/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55766\">Blackest Night</a></li><li><a href=\"/brightest-day/4050-37337/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37337\">Brightest Day</a></li><li><a href=\"/flashpoint-hal-jordan/4050-40928/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-40928\">Flashpoint: Hal Jordan</a></li><li><a href=\"/rise-of-the-third-army/4045-56863/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56863\">Rise Of The Third Army</a></li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><p>In the animated movie called <em>Batman: The Dark Knight</em> we see three comic books or graphic novels on the newsstand that where <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC Comics</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Darkforce is an energy unique to the Marvel Multiverse. It constitutes the Darkforce Dimension and has the ability to assume the properties of both matter and energy depending on the needs of the user. It has been stated that Darkforce is a sentient property, often possessing or corrupting those who use it. Several characters in the Marvel universe have shown some ability to manipulate Darkforce, often with dramatically different results:</p><p><b>Use for Teleportation</b></p><p>Characters, such as the mutants <a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a> and <a href=\"/vanisher/4005-6756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6756\">Vanisher,</a> are believed to make use of the Darkforce dimension to permit them to teleport distances. Characters enter the Darkforce Dimension, either through portals or direct teleportation, then vacate the Darkforce Dimension into some other (or in some instances, the same) location in the world.</p><p><b>General Manipulation</b></p><ul><li>The character <a href=\"/darkstar/4005-10990/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10990\">Darkstar</a>, perhaps the strongest wielder of the energy, possesses the ability to directly manipulate Darkforce, allowing her to create solid objects, fly, and teleport. She has also been able to disable Vanisher's control over the Darkforce Dimension, closing a portal around his body when he once tried to escape her - cutting him in half.<br /><a href=\"/cloak/4005-1474/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1474\">Cloak</a> can open a portal into the Darkforce Dimension. He also has the ability to teleport himself and others wrapped in his cloak, and to instill fear into those he envelops. He has often felt that the dimension wishes to corrupt him.</li><li>On the other hand, <a href=\"/black-mamba/4005-30719/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30719\">Black Mamba</a> uses Darkforce to create illusions which distract her opponents, often tapping into their greatest desire.</li><li><a href=\"/blackheart/4005-14728/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14728\">Blackheart</a> appears to live within the Darkforce Dimension, and as such has complete control over the energy.<br />Other characters who can manipulate Darkforce include: <a href=\"/asylum/4005-2095/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2095\">Asylum</a>, <a href=\"/blackout/4005-11839/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11839\">Blackout</a> (Daniels), <a href=\"/quagmire/4005-44490/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44490\">Quagmire</a>, <a href=\"/doorman/4005-2489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2489\">Doorman</a>, <a href=\"/ecstasy/4005-30685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30685\">Ecstasy</a>, <a href=\"/nightside/4005-13970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13970\">Nightside</a>, <a href=\"/shadowoman/4005-42522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42522\">Sepulchre</a>, <a href=\"/shroud/4005-13844/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13844\">Shroud</a>, <a href=\"/silhouette/4005-2119/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2119\">Silhouette</a>, <a href=\"/smuggler/4005-21992/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21992\">Smuggler</a>, <a href=\"/spot/4005-18270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18270\">Spot</a>, <a href=\"/nightwind/4005-10583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10583\">Nightwind</a>, <a href=\"/night/4005-7537/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7537\">Night</a> and <a href=\"/mister-negative/4005-49969/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49969\">Mister Negative</a>.</li><li>Darkstar II and III were able to manipulate the Darkforce in a way similar to the original; this was achieved through DNA grafts given to them by the Russian Government.

The base for the Coda was built in a desert called the Bay of Numbers. In the Bay, the grains of sand continually shaped and reshaped themselves into ever-changing geometric forms. Perfect spheres, cubes and other, seemingly random shapes would form out of the sand, but the order and placement of them never repeated (and never would for all eternity). Though Coincidental Mansion and the Bay of Numbers were just for decoration and entertainment, there are other Kherubim creations that serve more practical purposes. The most noticeble piece of Kherubim technology are the Spartan Guards. The Spartans are fully sentient robots that are built as personal bodyguards as well as a police force. Each Spartan has a \"brain\" more powerful than any other computer (on Earth or otherwise), is programmed to be able to use any technology it comes across, is equipped with powerful lasers, is skilled in armed and unarmed combat and has superhuman levels of strength, speed and durability. <a href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\">Spartan</a>, one of these androids, is a permanent member of the WildC.A.T.s and also shows up in several other comics. In the Majestic one-shot: <a href=\"/wildstorm-spotlight-majestic/4050-18001/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18001\">Wildstorm Spotlight: Majestic</a>, he gets so advanced that he becomes a god, a powerful example of the limits (or lack thereof) of Kherubim technology. Of all the Kherubim creations though, the Kheran Dream Engine may be the best. It can warp reality to make thoughts and dreams real.</p><h2>Space Travel</h2><p>The Kherubim have ships built (or more accurately \"grown\") for interstellar flight and in some cases, faster than light travel. These ships (and the other battle ships) are outfitted with some of Khera's best weaponry and are so massive, they could be considered small cities. Even with the speeds the ships can reach, travel can still take a long time depending on the destination or purpose of the trip so stasis pods are on the ships to allow the crew to store their bodies safely during travel. While in stasis, the mind of a sleeping Kherubim is stored in a crystal should anything happen to them. Upon reaching their destination, the mind is returned to the brain and body it came from. If something should happen to the body during flight, the crystal can be stored until a new body can be made for the mind to be put into. (This was actually what happened with <a href=\"/majestrate/4005-40691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40691\">Majestrate</a>.) Kheran ships have a unique control system that is operated by vocalizations. Kherans sing to their ships to get them to do what they want and the Kheran vocal range is different enough from other species (at least human and Daemonite) that they can't be piloted by non-kherans without extensive modification.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Though the Kherubim have awesome technology and a myriad of machines that can do their fighting for them, most choose to fight for themselves and use bladed weapons to do so. Just because the weapons are not as complex as guns and lasers though, doesn't mean they aren't as effecient as other Kherubim tools. Blades made by Kherubim technology (called Kusar Blades) are capable of cutting anything, even beings of <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>/<a href=\"/mr-majestic/4005-21972/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21972\">Mr. Majestic</a> level durability. Sentient swords have been created that can deliver energy blasts as they strike (if the sword deems it necessary) as well as perform other tasks in the hands of a skilled swordsman. A sword like this is not common though, and only the highest ranking and most deserving are given weapons like this. Majestic owns another special blade that hasn't been seen before. It is a large sword capable of changing its shape (even changing from a blade to a completely different weapon like a spiked ball and chain) and also releasing energy blasts and electrical charges. The fluid way that the sword changes shapes suggests that it might have been created through study of the Shaper's Guild. There are also special weapons for stealth combat. Quantum-Folded Combat Blades are invisible and can be shrunk to the size of a cell phone and enlarged for combat. Skintight Nanoflage suits make the wearer invisible to all forms of surveillance and High-Dose Damper Capsules are pills that remove the powers of whoever ingests them so their energy signature is also undetectable.All this is not to say that Kherubim don't have other, more complex weapons. The Kherubim have energy weapons, forcefield technology, genetic bombs and weapons created for large-scale warfare and world take-overs, it's just that they are rarely needed since the Kherubim themselves are war machines. One weapon that Kherubim possess is the Low-Grav Wallcrawler. It most resembles a normal Earth tank (with more cannons) but it can transform into an even bigger machine almost capable of going head to head with a Spartan Guard. These machines appear to be semi-sentient, able to be piloted or left to act on their own. The Kherubim also have bio-chemical weapons, one of which is the Haikyatu Armory. According to <a href=\"/emp/4005-21970/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21970\">Emp</a> it has two stages. The first is a bacteria bomb that destroys the nerve centers of all forms of life while keeping the bodies intact. The second stage reanimates and controls the bodies, creating an army of undead. Of course there are also the lasers and mega-bombs that most advanced races seem to have, but the Kherubim try not to totally destroy their enemies when they fight in case something can be gained from keeping them alive.</p><h2>Planet-Shapers</h2><p>Planet-Shapers are massive machines used for the colonization of new planets and the spread of Kherubim. The first Kherubim created Planet-Shapers, terraforming machines that could be sent to suitable planets and through a long process, would rebuild the Kherubim race there. The Planet-Shapers would land on a still-forming planet and stay dormant beneath the mantle until sentient life evolved on the planet. At this point, the Planet-Shaper would release Kherubim (made inside the machine from \"pure Kherubim gene-stock\" it carried) and the natural sentient race of the planet would be made into a servitor race. To ensure that the new Kherubim flourished, the Planet-Shapers would restructure climate and geographic conditions to best suit the Kherubim. Also, giant robots would come from the Planet-Shapers and kill most of the servitor race, thinning down their numbers so they would never pose a threat to the new Kherubim.</p><p> </p><h2>Kherubim Technology on Earth</h2><p>The Kherubim have been on Earth for thousands of years and as a result, a lot of their technology has mixed with human technology. In the <a href=\"/majestic/4050-18002/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18002\">Majestic</a> series, <a href=\"/desmond/4005-40665/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40665\">Desmond</a>, a child genius, reverse-engineered a lot of Kherubim technology for personal use. He made suits that let him act like a superhero and rebuilt his legs so he could walk (he had been paralyzed from the waist down). After he gave up being a superhero he started to use the Kherubim technology for commercial profit. He started a company and created the Quickthink 4-Tell, a phone with instant messaging, video and holo-still, internet access, mp3, voice actuation, 4-D surround playback, simulcast conference capabilities and more for less than 100 dollars. He became a millionaire and he wasn't the only one. <a href=\"/spartan/4005-12006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12006\">Spartan</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wildcats/4060-25113/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25113\">WildC.A.T.s</a>, used a mixture of Kherubim technology and <a href=\"/otherspace/4020-41058/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41058\">Otherspace</a> energy to in his own corporation. They sold batteries that lasted forever, cars that didn't need gas (and lasted forever) and computers that would never need to be upgraded or even plugged in. Other companies also used bits and pieces of Kherubim technology (though they didn't know it) and soon enough Earth was covered in \"xenotechnology\". In Wildcats v4, the latest volume, Spartan has begun to sell Spartan Guards as household tools and the world is eating them up.</p>",

It involves Colossus hurling his teammate at a foe. The attack allows Wolverine to reach speeds much faster than he ever could on his own, causing him to do much more damage. It also allows him get to areas that he couldn't before, such as extreme heights or distances. In the move, Colossus holds Wolverine in his hands and throws him with as much force as he can muster. Sometimes the throw is like a javelin and other times it looks like a baseball pitch, but the result is the same. The size difference between the two heroes involved makes this move easier than when it is tried with others. Colossus is very big so a small Wolverine fits right in his hand.</p><p>Though Colossus and Wolverine are known for the maneuver, it can work with almost any duo physically capable. Usually a being with super strength throws a smaller person for a direct assault, or a flying hero uses the momentum to throw another person. Most times when it is done without both Colossus and Wolverine, Colossus is the one missing.</p><p>While the maneuver was first dubbed the 'fastball special' by the X-Men, it's worth noting that Wolverine and Colossus were not the first to use the tactic. Currently, the earliest known appearance of this coordinated attack was in the <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man-spidey-strikes-back/4000-7481/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-7481\">December 1964 issue of <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></a>, where <a href=\"/ox/4005-38747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38747\">Ox</a> throws <a href=\"/fancy-dan/4005-13498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13498\">Fancy Dan</a> at <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> who is perched out of striking distance on the ceiling.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2911411\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.97574893009986\" data-width=\"701\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 701px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2911411\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg 701w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52074/2911411-fastball.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Some variations of the attack include:</p><ul><li>Wolverine throwing Colossus (twice, on the moon and in the afterlife)</li><li><a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rogue</a> throwing Colossus</li><li>Colossus throwing <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kitty Pryde</a></li><li><a href=\"/ox/4005-38747/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38747\">Ox</a> throwing <a href=\"/fancy-dan/4005-13498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13498\">Fancy Dan</a></li><li><a href=\"../../warpath/29-2158/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Warpath</a> throwing <a href=\"../../shatterstar/29-2156/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shatterstar</a></li><li><a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man</a> throwing Shadowcat</li><li><a href=\"../../maggott/29-15072/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Maggot</a> throwing <a href=\"../../marrow/29-13726/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Marrow</a></li><li><a href=\"../../strong-guy/29-7599/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Strong Guy</a> throwing <a href=\"../../jubilee/29-4562/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jubilee</a></li><li>Rogue throwing <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nightcrawler</a> (called the Deathstar Drop)</li><li>Spiderman throwing <a href=\"../../x-23/29-3560/\" rel=\"nofollow \">X-23</a></li><li><a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Juggernaut</a> throwing <a href=\"../../nocturne/29-4565/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nocturne</a></li><li><a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Thing</a> throwing Wolverine</li><li><a href=\"../../squirrel-girl/29-2488/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Squirrel Girl</a> throwing a squirrel (aptly named the Fuzzball Special)</li><li><a href=\"../../flatman/29-2487/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Flatman</a> throwing <a href=\"../../doorman/29-2489/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doorman</a> (to teleport the target)</li><li><a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ms. Marvel</a> throwing Wolverine</li><li>Ultimate Colossus throwing <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kitty Pryde</a></li><li><a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beast</a> throwing <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kitty Pryde</a></li><li><a href=\"../../angel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Angel</a> throwing (or dropping) Colossus</li><li>Wolverine riding <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cannonball</a> (Cannonball Special)</li><li><a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sabretooth</a> throwing <a href=\"../../elsie-dee/29-15690/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Elsie Dee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../mimic/29-12546/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mimic</a> throwing himself copying the abilities of Colossus &amp;

Regardless, it is the power source for the <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>.</p><p>All DC characters who are called \"speedsters\" are connected to the Speed Force regardless of the origin of their powers; it is said that when they die, speedsters become one with the Speed Force, something of a Valhalla for speedsters. That said, not every DC <a href=\"/metahuman/4015-55705/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55705\">super-humans</a> that can travel at high velocities is connected to the Speed Force, only the ones whose primary power is superhuman speed. For example, <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman,</a> though he is very fast, has no connection to the Speed Force. The same holds true for the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/4060-6992/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6992\">Green Lanterns</a>, who can traverse the galaxy at incredible speeds. Additionally, characters who are explicitly stated to be mimicking super-speed without being speedsters themselves, such as <a href=\"/zoom/4005-41085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41085\">Hunter Zolomon</a>, who uses time manipulation to operate as the villain Zoom, are not connected to the Speed Force.</p><p><a href=\"/max-mercury/4005-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2379\">Max Mercury</a> believed that it is <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a> himself who generates the Speed Force with every step that he runs. However, it was revealed that the Speed Force has always existed, and it's continual action of pushing the Multiverse forward builds up pressure between the barrier of time and space. As such, the Speed Force chooses conduits, like Barry, to act as \"release valves.\" As a speedster runs, they relieve the pressure being built up and prevent hazardous rips in space time from occurring.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910096\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103554/1910096-speedforce.png\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.81538461538462\" data-width=\"325\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 325px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103554/1910096-speedforce.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1910096\"><img alt=\"The Speed Force\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/103554/1910096-speedforce.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/103554/1910096-speedforce.png 325w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/103554/1910096-speedforce.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Speed Force</figcaption></figure><p>During the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> event, <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a>, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\">Jay Garrick</a>, and <a href=\"/bart-allen/4005-1680/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1680\">Bart Allen</a> grabbed <a href=\"/superboy-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy Prime</a> and tried running him into the Speed Force. When Jay Garrick had to stop and Wally West disappeared, Bart Allen knew he could not push the villain into the Speed Force alone; Barry Allen, Max Mercury, and <a href=\"/jesse-chambers/4005-9345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9345\">Jesse Quick</a> then grabbed Superboy Prime and pulled him in. This revealed that they live on in the Speed Force.</p><p>The Speed Force is usually depicted as lightning and blurs of yellow and red. This is because the Speed Force is used mostly by <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>es throughout <a href=\"/dc-comics/4010-10/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-10\">DC</a> history and these are their symbols and colors.</p><h2>Characters associated with the Speed Force</h2><ul><li><b>Barry Allen</b>, The second Flash and first to actively (and unconsciously) channel the Speed Force. After Bart returned to Earth so that he could absorb the Speed Force, Barry gave his grandson his costume, choosing to remain within the Force. Professor Zoom, however, sensed his old enemy's return and sent a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to reawaken Barry's self awareness and bring him back to the physical world so he could engineer his revenge.</li><li>The first Flash <b>Jay Garrick</b>, originally couldn't even run at the speed of sound until he met Barry Allen and began to tap into the Speed Force. He could then run 20 times as fast. Despite this he was unable to keep up with the many speedsters when they entered the Speed Force to entrap Superboy-Prime and when Bart returned and absorbed the Speed Force, Jay's powers began to swiftly diminish. Eventually however, when Bart apparently met his demise, Jay's powers have returned to their full strength.</li><li><b>Wally West</b>, the third Flash, his powers were connected to the Speed Force, a dimension he chose to live in during Infinite Crisis. He turned into a being of pure speed energy and came to his wife, <a href=\"/linda-park-west/4005-2394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2394\">Linda Park West</a> who grabbed onto him and so they and their children, <a href=\"/jai-west/4005-46070/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46070\">Jai West</a> and <a href=\"/iris-west/4005-46069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46069\">Iris West</a> vanished into the Speed Force. There they remained for many years, so that the twins could age without any pressure on their lives from Wally's superhero life.</li><li>The second Kid Flash and fourth Flash, <b>Bart Allen's</b> powers came from the Speed Force, and at one time he wished to lose this connection, fearing the Speed Force. This was because during Infinite Crisis he was brought into the Speed Force where he aged four years and returned, only to absorb the Speed Force into himself, claiming it was gone. Recently he has been de-aged and become Kid Flash again.</li><li><a href=\"/johnny-quick/4005-36717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36717\"><b>Johnny Quick</b></a>, to save his daughter's life, ran into the Speed Force, and merged with it. He somehow tapped into the Speed Force by visualizing a mathematical formula in his mind and saying it out loud.</li><li><b>Jesse Chambers</b>, known as <a href=\"/jesse-chambers/4005-9345/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9345\">Liberty Belle</a>, inherited her connection to the Speed Force from her father and his speed formula but has flip-flopped between using it or powers inherited from her mother. She has also gone by the name Jesse Quick.</li><li><a href=\"/max-mercury/4005-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2379\"><b>Max Mercury</b></a>, The 'Zen Master of the Speed Force' is a speedster from the past who jumped several times into the future until he arrived in the present. He was guardian to Bart Allen who had arrived from the future and understands the Speed Force probably better than anyone else. He could converse with spirits of those trapped in the Speed Force through meditation and ended up trapped there until Barry Allen brought him back.</li><li>Reverse-Flash, <b>Eobard Thawne</b>, was sucked into the Speed Force and there he went insane after remaining there for 50 years. When he returned he wreaked havoc and eventually became a being of pure speed energy who has possessed the body of Max Mercury, thus condemning Max to the Speed Force.</li><li><b><a href=\"/savitar/4005-48688/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48688\">Savitar</a></b> developed powers from the Speed Force other speedsters had not, creating a cult based around himself. He murdered people in order to gain speed until Wally West forced him into the Speed Force. Shortly after Barry Allen returned from the Speed Force, Savitar used Barry as a doorway to engineer his own escape; however, Barry's touch caused Savitar to be consumed by the Negative Speed Force that Professor Zoom had infected Barry with.</li><li>Impulse, <b>Iris West</b> is the daughter of Wally West and Linda Park West. At first she and her twin brother <b>Jai West</b> shared a connection to the Speed Force and them fighting over it caused them to manifest unconventional powers for speedsters. During <i><a href=\"/the-flash-rebirth/4045-55893/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55893\">Flash: Rebirth</a></i> she severed Jai's connection to the Speed Force and gained the full connection gaining traditional super speed and choosing to call herself Impulse. She is possibly Bart Allen's biggest fan.</li><li><a href=\"/xs/4005-40802/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40802\"><b>XS</b></a>, a descendant of Barry Allen and cousin to Bart Allen, is a superhero in the 31st century. She too is connected to the Speed Force.</li><li><a href=\"/black-flash/4005-43141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43141\"><b>The Black Flash</b></a> is a Grim Reaper of sorts for speedsters. When near death, all speedsters connected to the Speed Force must face the Black Flash and unless they are able to outrun him they die. When Barry Allen was infected with the Negative Speed Force Wally West called him the new Black Flash.</li></ul><h2>The Negative Speed Force</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1491811\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.95765472312704\" data-width=\"614\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 614px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:95.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1491811\"><img alt=\"Eobard Thawne - Generator of the Negative Speed Force\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eobard Thawne - Generator of the Negative Speed Force\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/59688/1491811-reverse_flash_family_001.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eobard Thawne - Generator of the Negative Speed Force</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, in <i>Flash: Rebirth</i>, it was revealed that Professor Zoom created a 'Negative Speed Force' that eats away at the regular Speed Force like a cancer and can consume any speedster connected to it by touch. Professor Zoom himself is the engine that generates this Negative Speed Force with every step that he runs. He used it to infect Barry Allen in the hopes that the Negative Speed Force would consume Barry's loved ones and other speedsters who rely on it, consuming Barry in grief so that he'd merge with the Speed Force.

It is usually referred to in terms of different barriers: The Sound barrier, Light barrier, Time Barrier, Dimensional Barrier, and finally the Speed Force Barrier. It introduced several \"new\" powers to Flash and other Speed Force-powered persons. Some of these powers had previously existed during the DC <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a>, but were later explained as manifestations of the Speed Force.</p><p>The Speed Force can be used to various effect including time travel, faster-than-light travel, speed duplicates, constructs using Speed Force energy, faster healing and speed stealing or lending. It also provides speedsters the ability to function at unnatural speeds without the laws of physics stopping them. Those within the Speed Force are protected from heat or bearing the brunt of impacts at any speed they travel. It also lets them breathe, receive stimuli (sight, hearing, etc.), and avoid completely destroying themselves and the world around them as they move. It can even be used to hold enemies indefinitely.</p><p>Here is a list of abilities granted by the Speed Force:</p><p><b>Superhuman Speed </b>- Speed Force users can move at incredible superhuman speeds, sometimes surpassing even the speed of light.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Reflexes </strong>-Speed Force enhances the users reflexes to inhuman levels, allowing them to easily react to danger and perceive time in slow motion.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Agility </strong>- Speed Force users posses greater balance, equilibrium, and bodily coordination than any normal human.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Stamina</strong> - Speed Force users possess near limitless levels of stamina.</p><p><strong>Infinite Mass Punch - </strong>When The Flash begins traveling near light speed he gains the relative mass of such a great speed allowing him to strike with blows with the force of \"a white dwarf star.</p><p><b>Speed Lend/Steal</b> - His most useful new power, <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a> could \"rob\" objects of their kinetic energy and, for example, stop bullets in flight or convert a supervillain to a statue and use the \"stolen\" kinetic energy to accelerate his movement. He could similarly lend his speed to objects or allies, enabling them to temporarily travel almost as fast as himself.</p><p><b>Regenerative Healing</b> <strong>Factor</strong> - Using the Speed Force to accelerate his healing factor, Wally West could heal from deadly injuries, without aging. While he was in the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">Justice League Of America</a>, Wally could use this power to heal his other team members by accelerating their healing factors without aging them. Most speedsters can quickly regenerate from injuries.</p><p><strong>Speed Force Aura: </strong>Speed Force users are surrounded by an aura of kinetic absorbent energy, allowing them to be unaffected by the effects of moving at super-speed, such as friction, g force, and kinetic impact.</p><ul><li><strong>Superhuman Durability </strong>- Because of their resistance to kinetic impacts, Speed Force users are far more durable and resistant to injury than any normal human.</li></ul><p><strong>Speed Force Lightning - </strong>All speedsters generate electrical Speed Force energy from their bodies. This electricity varies in color, but is usually depicted as yellow. Some speedsters have used this energy to their advantage, such as when Bart Allen charged his hand with it, to shock Jay Garrick back to life. Some speedsters can also forcefully discharge a large blast of electricity from their body.</p><ul><li><strong>Lightning Bolt Projection </strong>- Some speedsters, such as Barry Allen, have learned to manipulate their Speed Force lightning in the way that they could manually project it from their hands as bolts of lightning.</li></ul><p><b>Energy Constructs</b> - Wally West made the discovery that if he concentrated he could create solid energy constructs using the Speed Force. He has used this ability to protect against disease, create pockets for holding items, and to compose a bullet-proof costume.</p><p><b>Shield</b> - Exhibited by Savitar, whose Speed Force mastery allows him to reflect objects away from himself.</p><p><b>Flight</b> - Exhibited by <a href=\"/johnny-quick/4005-5695/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5695\">Johnny Quick</a> and his daughter Jesse Quick.</p><p><b>ESP</b> - Used by <a href=\"/max-mercury/4005-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2379\">Max Mercury</a>, whose strong connection with the Speed Force allows him to detect the motion of any object around the world and also to perceive other speedsters. Wally West also exhibited this ability to perceive Linda across time and space.</p><p><b>Total Recall</b> - Bart Allen as the Flash used this ability to remember everything he reads using his super-speed.

Most notably, Pym Particles can affect an object's size, enlarging or shrinking it. However, it was later established by <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Scott Lang</a> that they also affect the strength and durability of an object as well.</p><p>Eventually this elixir was made into a gas so if could be quickly aspirated for easier transportation. After accidentally transforming into Giant-Man, Pym further refined the chemical into a variety of color-coded pills. The particles still proved unstable as they trapped Pym at a height of 12 feet. Pym Particles work by the user either shunting mass to the \"Kosmos Dimension\" (for shrinking) or taking mass (for growing).</p><p>After repeated exposure to an unknown amount of Pym Particles, users can change size without having to take any more Pym Particles to trigger the change. Examples of this are Hank Pym, <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Janet van Dyne</a>, and <a href=\"/stature/4005-40516/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40516\">Cassie Lang</a>. <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Simon Williams</a>, who was given energy powers by <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/4005-3278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3278\">Baron Zemo</a> using Pym Particle-charged ions, was also permanently altered by these treatments along the strength and durability axes, but could not alter his size until directly treated with Pym Particles. Most uniforms for users of Pym Particles are treated with the particles so that they grow and shrink as the users do.</p><h2>Users of Pym Particles</h2><p>Users of Pym Particles include:</p><ul><li>Hank Pym</li><li>Wasp (Janet Van Dyne)</li><li><a href=\"/clint-barton/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a> (Clint Barton )</li><li><a href=\"/atlas/4005-3277/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3277\">Atlas</a> (Erik Josten)</li><li><a href=\"/goliath/4005-3470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3470\">Goliath</a> (Bill Foster)</li><li><a href=\"/black-goliath/4005-12341/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12341\">Goliath</a> (Tom Foster)</li><li><a href=\"/scott-lang/4005-20577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20577\">Ant-Man</a> (Scott Lang)</li><li><a href=\"/eric-ogrady/4005-6774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6774\">Ant-Man</a> (Eric O'Grady)</li><li>Stature (Cassandra Lang)</li><li>Wonder Man (Simon Williams)</li><li><a href=\"/man-killer/4005-14575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14575\">Amazon</a> (Katerina van Horn)</li><li><a href=\"/rita-demara/4005-1501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1501\">Yellowjacket</a> (Rita DeMara)</li></ul><h2>Side effects of Pym Particles</h2><p>Some users of Pym Particles have had some side effects as a result of using them too much. The most notable is Hank Pym. Hank had several mental breakdowns, potentially from the strain of using Pym Particles, causing him to react differently from how he normally does. During one such breakdown he developed a new hyper-masculine heroic persona named Yellowjacket, who he felt would be more worthy of marriage to Van Dyne.</p><p>Another potential side effect is being stuck in an altered state. Pym was once unable to shrink down from his giant form for an extended duration otherwise the strain on his body would kill him.</p>",

Before she was able to finish a cure, MacTaggert succumbed to a mutated strain. Beast, however was able to combine their work and reverse engineer a strain of the virus that would essentially eradicate all other strains. Once this harmless version was airborne, the cure would spread around the world in a matter of days. Unfortunately, the virus only becomes airborne upon the death of an infected mutant. Therefore, Beast's cure would require one mutant to sacrifice his life to release the cure. Believing this to be too high a price to pay, Beast abandoned the cure and returned to the drawing board. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\"> Colossus</a>, however, never stopped mourning for his sister, <a href=\"/illyana-rasputin/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\"> Illyana Rasputin</a>, who was among the first victims of the Legacy outbreak.

      "description": "<h2>History and Culture</h2><p><a href=\"/tuk/4005-34714/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34714\">Tuk the caveboy</a> was the first offispring of Inhumans, living in 50000 BC.</p><p>Terrigenesis was discovered about 25,000 years ago by the Inhuman geneticist <a href=\"/randac/4005-14594/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14594\"> Randac</a>. Upon discovery of the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/4055-55807/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55807\"> Terrigen Crystals</a> which produce the mists, Randac exposed himself to the vapors they created giving him immense psychic abilities. Randac wanted exposure to the Mists to be mandatory in Inhuman culture. The results were often disastrous. Many mutated into deformed monsters. Others mutated into an to an offshoot race of the <a href=\"/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\"> Inhumans</a>, the <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/4015-23691/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-23691\"> Alpha Primitives</a>. Alpha Primitives are mules of Inhuman society: sterile, stupid, and barely functional other than the menial tasks of keeping the machinery that runs the Inhuman city of <a href=\"/attilan/4020-44155/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-44155\"> Attilan</a> running smoothly. Because of the problems with Terrigenesis, the Genetic Council was charged with the task of managing Terrigenesis to ensure that Inhumans are genetically compatible with the process before exposure.</p><p>Terrigenesis creates seemingly random mutations in those exposed, unlocking their genetic potential. Each Inhuman responds to the process differently and varies in both appearance and powers gained. Terrigenesis has become such a key aspect of Inhuman culture that it is considered sacred. Much of the Inhuman religion and culture is centered around Terrigenesis. It is considered a rite of passage for Inhuman children. Upon reaching a certain age, children are put into classes where they are paired up with other children of the same age to learn about Inhuman society, religious tradition, and culture. Graduation is in the form of the Terrigenesis, and is an important moment for both the individual and the entire family. Mutations that are key to Inhuman society may be a cause for celebration for the entire race.</p><h2>Exposure</h2><p>The process of Terrigenesis can be extremely dangerous despite rigorous control on the part of the Genetic Council. Mutations very greatly in function and level of power. Mutations vary in every way imaginable including energy forms, psychic mutations, plant and animal control, sonic control, healing, death, strength, blast powers, flying, elemental manipulation, mutation enhancement, and much much more. Some of the least powerful Inhumans can do little more than change skin pigment. Some of the more powerful can level mountains, kill with a gaze, or more.</p><p>The unlocking of genetic potential that occurs in Inhumans during Terrigenesis seems to be random in nature, based on the genetic code of the individual alone. It has been revealed that through Terrigenesis Inhumans fulfill a greater destiny through Terrigenesis. When viewed from a higher level, it is evident that Terrigenesis is not only to enhance the individual, but to adapt for the benefit of society in preparation of the future. When an Inhuman with a mutation that is key to Inhuman society dies a replacement mutation occurs within a matter of three years. Times of strife or conflict, or times of great climate change will facilitate mutations appropriate to the circumstances.</p><h2>Compatibility</h2><p>Exposure by those who are not genetically compatible with Terrigenesis can be dangerous for those involved. Disastrous mutations can occur and in some rare instances exposure can cause one to cease to exist (even if genetically compatible). Exposure by humans results in Inhuman-like mutations, but the powers and abilities gained as well as the test subject do not last long. The body rapidly begins to burn out and deteriorate. This begins with rapid onset of some of the features of old age, and in later stages will leave little more than a corpse-like husk. Death is imminent.</p><p>Exposure to human <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\"> Mutant</a> can result in the further development of their powers, but at a high price. After <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\"> M-Day</a> several de-powered mutants were exposed to the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\"> Terrigen Mists</a>, resulting in the re-gaining of their mutant abilities at a level which they had never experienced before. Some of the enhanced mutations recorded in mutants (or former mutants) are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/unus/4005-3438/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3438\"> Unus</a> regained his force field, but was suffocated by it as it no longer let oxygen through.</li><li><a href=\"/freakshow/4005-4994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4994\"> Freakshow</a> regained his shape-shifting abilities, but was stuck in the form of a giant disfigured monster with no way to communicate.</li><li><a href=\"/callisto/4005-3423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\"> Callisto</a>'s senses were heightened to the point where she was put in a coma from the sensation of raindrops on her skin.</li><li><a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\"> Quicksilver</a> regained the ability to speed up his body to the point where he could jump from one time to another.</li><li><a href=\"/wicked/4005-3425/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3425\"> Wicked</a> regained her ability to summon the spirits of the dead, but could no longer control them. These spirits began to torment her.</li></ul><p>Secondary exposure of Inhumans is also extremely dangerous, and leads to further mutation. <a href=\"/gorgon/4005-4330/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4330\"> Gorgon</a> was exposed to the mists a second time by the United States government when they captured the Terrigen Crystals causing him to mutate into a large beast.

For this reason, acquiring the equation is the utmost goal of <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>, Lord of <a href=\"/apokolips/4020-41470/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41470\">Apokolips</a>.

Very little has been confirmed of the Anti-Life equation. What is known is that a key part of the equation is held within the subconsciousness of the human mind.</p><p>It is believed that any tool used to control another person, such as fear, torture, pain and lies are parts of the Anti-Life Equation.Very few have knowledge of the full equation, but notably Scott Free <a href=\"/mr-miracle/4005-5703/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5703\">Mr. Miracle</a> has been found to know it, but has the willpower not to use it.In issue #3 of Red Robin, Tim Drake told Cassie Sandsmark (the second Wonder Girl) that he was in Gotham during the Crisis and heard the Anti-Life Equation.

Using <a href=\"/mad-hatter/4005-5814/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5814\">Mad Hatter</a> technology, Darkseid creates helmets that play the Anti-Life Equation on an infinite loop in the wearer's ears, effectively making them his mindless slaves, his <a href=\"/justifiers/4060-56094/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56094\">Justifiers</a>. If the helmets are removed he will lose control over them.</p><h2>DCnU</h2><p>The functions of the equation remain much the same as they did in old continuity with quite a few alterations, it has come into the hands of multiple users.

      "deck": "Comics and graphic novels have given us many famous and notable advertisements through the years. Who can forget the Charles Atlas ads, the X-Ray Specks, Sea Monkeys, or the mysterious Grab Bag?",
      "description": "<p>Here is a feature gallery where we will present some of the most memorable (and sometimes most horrible) advertisements ever to grace the pages of our beloved comic book medium. Peruse and enjoy this modern gallery of pulchritude and go away with a smile. Return again, bringing your own examples of advertising virtuosity from the comic Ages past. Our tour begins with those muscle-bound and true-to-life strongmen who inspired us to no longer be the wimp at the beach.</p><h2>Charles Atlas, He'll Make a Man Out of You</h2><p><a href=\"/charles-atlas/4005-178310/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-178310\">Charles Atlas</a> ruled the advertisement pages for years, becoming an icon in the eyes of young boys everywhere. Atlas was the living embodiment of the superhero physique, and proof that the \"90 lbs. weakling\" can grow up to kick butt and take names. He had the confidence to wear a leopard print bikini bottom and stand like he had a stuck up his rear, and managed to make it look cool. Thank you, Charles Atlas for sharing your pecks with the world.</p><p>Next stop on our tour, the wonderful world of action figures.</p><h2>Get Some Action (Figures)</h2><p>If you were a man-child of the 70's or 80's (and probably the 90's as well), you played with action figures. Let's face it guys, \"action figures\" are just what we call them so we can say we DON'T play with dolls, but the outcome is the same nonetheless. Above are two of the absolute coolest of the cool. Who in their right mind DIDN'T want a gold plated Cylon. And don't get me started on the Warrior action figure. He was the baddest @$$-kicker of them all.</p><p>G.I. Joe had his own kickin' rescue and attack dog. Look at him go! Name another dog that can use a zip-line or keep tabs on the enemy via periscope. Look at the longevity of the G.I. Joe line. It's possible that you had some Joes passed down to you from a big brother, or maybe even a dad, and you might have passed them down to your own children. I know I did.</p><p>Does ANYBODY remember Major Matt Mason? I'm sure he was the coolest astronaut hero of his day, but looking back now I wonder what the \"tech\" designers for the toy line were thinking. Look at the \"wheels\" of that space crawler, and the flying treadmill \"space sled,\" that's some well-tested equipment there I'm sure. What's with the moon suit? It looks like more like a buoy out in New York harbor. ROM the Space Knight was SO much cooler. He even had his own (fairly) successful comic title for a short while, created just to boost toy sales. Remember when Forge built that gun based on ROM's Neutralizer for use on Rogue, but it ended up getting used on Storm and erasing her powers for years? Good times.</p><p>Quite possibly the best action figures EVER, the Star Wars collection ruled the school playgrounds of America in the late 70s and early 80s. If you brought a new figure to school, you were the coolest cat for the day, at least until your playground nemesis brought another one hot off the shelf. Yet another set of figures to pass down to your children. Then there's Stretch Armstrong, an \"action figure\" you could stretch him as far as you wanted and he would snap back into his original shape. My friends and I actually snapped the head off of one of these things. I'm not kidding when I say that it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.</p><h2>Suck It Up Soldier!</h2><p>Look at that high technology at work. Buy this green and brown face paint and you can become almost INVISIBLE. I love the line, \"Give you a SECRET advantage over your enemies.\" Yeah, like the people the US army fought in WWII and Korea didn't know how to smear paint on their faces. It's not so politically correct anymore it seems to play with little toy soldiers. I've had the hardest time finding them for my son when he wanted them. Back when some of us were children, you could just order the things out of any comic book any time.</p><p>See that ad on the right above, I remember ordering that set of toy soldiers and thinking, \"I can't wait until that footlocker comes in, that's gonna be so cool.\" Yeah, right. Read the fine print stuck in there right above footlocker. What 8 year old boy is going to read the find print, or really even care what \"pasteboard\" is? I think that \"footlocker\" lasted a whole day.</p><h2>It's Alive! It's Alive!</h2><p>You could order live animals through the mail? Real live animals? And since when is a RACOON America's favorite pet? Easy to care for? If you like rabies, I guess so.</p><p>Why is it so many of these live animals are coming out of Florida? Were they trying to make more room for geriatric retirees and hot girls?</p><p>Why do they keep putting those poor little animals in teacups? Do they come in a teacup? Is that even really safe. And why does that old woman keep calling us \"Friends?\" I've never spoken with this woman ever, have you?</p><p>OK, so this last one's really not a live animal, but tell me if you can resist. If you had an air bladder in your hand with an air tube running up your shirtsleeve nowadays, I wonder what people would think you're hiding. It STILL might have something to do with a snake (or not).</p><h2>It Ain't Easy Being Green</h2><p>How about some live plants in the mail to go along with your live animals? Read the fine print on the 2D Chia Pet wannabes: \"Purchase of $1 or more automatically makes you a member of the Lucky Clover Club. You receive a genuine four-leaf clover for good luck.\" Man, what a deal!</p><h2>Oh, How Novel!</h2><p>I love the hokey buzz lines they use on these old things. \"Eyes will pop as friends gasp!\"</p><p>\"The most fantasmagorical hobby kit in the history of everything.\" What does that even mean? And \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" just sounds dirty.</p><p>Just imagine how much you could get on Ebay for one of those Gene Autry friendship rings. The 147 automobiles looks good, but notice the \"Garage.\" Yet another press board box.</p><p>Here's the trick section of the comic ads. How many kids fell for the \"$1 million\" gag because they didn't read the fine print to see that it was fake money? Aren't \"exact reproductions\" illegal? Maybe they made enough money off of the scam to pay their lawyers. Then you have the \"Lucky Grab Bag\" full of prizes, some of which were \"formerly up to $10.\" Read, \"this is leftover crap, and it's better to have you pay us a buck for it and clear out our warehouse.\"</p><p>\"Tell your parents every ingredient in the Margaret O'Brien Candy Kitchen is guaranteed to be absolutely wholesome.\" Yeah right. Those little bottles have just a slight resemblance to mini-bar bottles. The Vac-U-Form toys all look pretty good, but what's up with the bird and the cow?</p><p>Look at the Texas Ranch scam. Somebody do the math for me and find out how many square inches are in an acre. I have a feeling that somebody made a killing off of their land. I mean, have you ever been to Amarillo, TX?</p><p>\"Kids, we'll give you a free toy if you buy our cereal. Yes, it tastes like crap, but you'll be having so much fun you'll never notice.\" In Junior's Television you have a real visionary at work. Who knew that just a couple of decades later we really would have rear projection TVs in our homes?</p><p>Look at the \"Chinese\" guy up at the top of the magic tricks page. You couldn't get away with that kind of thing today, and that's a good thing.</p><p>I want my money back! I ordered the X-Ray specs when I was a kid and all I got was a headache. I never once saw the black silhouette of a woman through her clothes.</p><p>OMG! The Shocker?!?</p><h2>Win Fabulous Cash &amp; Prizes</h2><p>Who cares about the cars on the right, we've got Linda Carter in a Wonder Woman outfit. The contest was to finish a sentence in 50 words or less. Here's my entry: \"The daring rescue I would like to see Wonder Woman perform is...you and me alone together at the end. You're hot.\" I don't think I would have won.</p><h2>Eat, Drink, and Be Merry...</h2><p>I love the tag lines here. \"Hep cats purr over the fresh, clean taste of 7-Up.\" \"Delicious for folks of action!\"</p><p>What?!? A guy named \"Captain Tootsie\" rescues a guy named \"Fatty\" after he jumps off of building with an umbrella? He probably would've just bounced.</p><p>Why are Nazi's shooting at a little kid? That just doesn't make any sense. I guess you really don't have to be much of a superhero when your arch nemesis is Dr. Narsty, and the best he can do is fire a cork into your mouth that a bunch of kids can pull out.</p><p>I guess the original Captain Tootsie was a cowboy, but he didn't work out so they fired him. I'm not touching the strip on R.C. and the Adventures of \"Quickie\" if you know what I mean.</p><h2>Become an Artist</h2><p>\"Learn to draw like us, even though we're not good enough to get our art into this comic unless we pay for an ad.\"</p><p>Yeah, I remember in school the guys who could draw well got all the girls. So did the guys in drama and chess club.</p><h2>Buy This Comic!</h2><p>I think I see why Daredevil Comics failed. Look at the character names: Nightro? Dash Dillon? Pat Patriot? Trés original. I wish I had gotten a hold on some of those Mary Marvel glow pictures though. Yummy!</p><p>Glow in the dark <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/kryptonite/4055-32213/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-32213\">Kryptonite</a> rocks? It's terrific! It's fantastic! It's Kryptonastic!</p><p>And here's my second favorite part--when you wear it too long, it turns your finger green.</p><p>I love how they draw you in with the plight of the poor, homeless superhero, then throw the Frazetta naked chick art at you. Why is Wonder Woman the biggest doll? Not that I'm complaining, but are they trying to tell me something? I can't make fun of the Titans though, that was one of the best teams of all time.</p><p>Here's another great, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/all-new-collectors-edition-56-superman-vs-muhammad/4000-303801/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-303801\">Muhammed Ali vs. Superman</a> fight. Hey, isn't that Cassius Clay? Underoos are actually the biggest kid rip-off ever. I mean, think about it. You get these really cool superhero uniforms, but you have to wear them under your clothes. Every body stares at you if you wear them on the outside of your clothes, at least they did me.</p><p>What is FOOM! I guess they had to make it \"Friends Of Ol' Marvel,\" because if it were \"Friends Of Marvel\" the acronym would have been FOM, and that's just stupid. FOOM is much better. Now I know why I haven't seen Mockingbird in years. Hawkeye killed her making one of these stupid ads.</p><p>\"Life has no meaning without my latest Marvels.\" Get a life Spidey!</p><h2>Go, Go Gadget Gizmo!</h2><p>Way to promote a healthy lifestyle to the kiddies there, Mr. Bar-B-Q whatever-your-name-is.</p><p>\"Flying saucers are real!\" Wow! Call the CIA, call MI6, call ANYBODY! Aliens are here and they're driving frisbees! And if someone could explain the scientific principle of differential expansion, please send your answers (and refund requests) to Trek Space Ships (wow, do you think they were jumping on a particular band wagon or what?)</p><p>It's those x-ray specs again. They can guarantee me fun but not genuine x-ray vision? Pah! That's just not good enough! I'd say the only thing that will end up \"blushingly funny\" is me when I wander into the party wearing those thick-rimmed spectacles.</p><h2>Lots of Toys for Boys and Girls</h2><p>GoBots! The-almost-but-not-quite-Transformers. Build your very own transforming car / space ship / aeroplane. If only Tonka had had the marketing capabilities of Hasbro, it would be a GoBots movie craze instead of the Transformers.</p><p>SILLY PUTTY! That's all I've got to say on the matter.</p><p>Oh those were the days... life was good, spirits were high and skates had two and two. None of your \"in-line\" business. Oh no, we were real kids back when I were a lass, with our stablisers and cabbage-patch dolls. Funny thing is, I think my very first pair of skates really were strap on Winchesters, and they were old fashioned even back then.</p><h2>Deal or No Deal?</h2><p>Entrepreneurial spirit starts here folks. First you get your bike, then you get your paper round, then the whole world is your oyster! Alternatively, you could invest your allowance in stamps, the hobby of small kids and anoraks everywhere. Most of us grew out of it but there's still those few, lurking in the background, who geek-out at just the thought of a penny black.</p><h2>Heath, Hygiene, and Safety</h2><h2>Huckster Heroes</h2><h2>Make Your First Dollar</h2><h2>Ninjas Rule</h2><h2>The Monster Mash</h2><h2>Sports Stars</h2><h2>Oh No, OJ!</h2><h2>Before There Was MTV</h2><p>Oh David, how the gorgeous have aged!

Essentially, it features rock musician Meatloaf calling out in desperation to aid the children of the Special Olympics. Note the tears streaming down his face in the first panel. The advertisement appears to start out with Meatloaf performing at a concert, on a stage in front of a crowd, but he becomes distracted from his show and shouts out \"But who's gonna help me?\" rather than this confusing the audience (because his first lines were in a thought bubble and thereby the audience would not have understood what he needed help with), his audience is replaced altogether by a random grab back of assorted Marvel characters plus a few random children.</p><p>Meatloaf then informs us that the way we can help is by filling out a form for a cassette or record for the official theme song to the 1987 Special Olympics.</p><p>Panel to panel the conversation has little logical flow, and the end conclusion doesn't seem like it warranted Meatloaf getting as upset as he did. He was putting on a concert, isn't that the perfect time to say \"hey I just did a song to help out the Special Olympics, go out and pick it up!\"? Instead he gives up on his audience and enlists the help of Marvel super-heroes (and children). Whatever works for ya, Meat.</p><p>And by the final panel, in contrast to the first where tears are streaming down his face, Meatloaf looks totally jazzed! It's like his anguish was all an act and he was really waiting to tell us to fill out the form all along. Faker.</p><p>This ad is so nonsensical and random that it's charming. Hail Meatloaf, Humongous Rock Star of the Universe.</p><h2>Volto From Mars</h2><p><a href=\"/volto/4005-115733/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-115733\">Volto</a> was a superhero from <a href=\"/mars/4020-55781/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55781\">Mars</a> with magnetic powers. Each issue that he appeared in <a href=\"/nedor/4010-2260/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2260\">Nedor Comics</a>, Volto would be a regular comic superhero story until the end when he announces he recharges his power by eating Grape Nut Flakes. The last panel would have a boy holding up a plain looking cereal box of Grape Nuts and tell you that you may not get magnetic powers but it will give you a Dynamo Drive.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Types of Sigils</h2> <p>In the CrossGen imprint of comics, Sigil-bearers are the central focus of most of the individual titles, and figure largely into the overall structure of the CrossGen universe, otherwise known as the Sigilverse.</p> <p>There are essentially three types of Sigil-bearers, and two of these groups can be further broken down into smaller groups. All <a data-ref-id=\"4055-41551\" href=\"/sigil/4055-41551/\" slug=\"sigil\">   Sigils</a> are marks given to individuals by beings who have undergone a <a data-ref-id=\"4015-43082\" href=\"/transition/4015-43082/\" slug=\"transition\">   Transition</a>, or ascenion to become god-like beings. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42974\" href=\"/solusandra/4005-42974/\" slug=\"solusandra\">   Solusandra</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42966\" href=\"/danik/4005-42966/\" slug=\"danik\">   Danik</a> are tranisioned Atlanteans from Earth's ancient past (over 100,000 years in the past). All of Solusandra's Sigil-bearers are human, while most of Danik's are un-ascended Atlanteans with the remaining two being human. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13218\" href=\"/charon/4005-13218/\" slug=\"charon\">   Charon</a>, the evil god of the Negation universe, learns how to give a similar symbol, called a Ligis, to non-human creatures with the aid of the Sigil-bearer <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13208\" href=\"/javi/4005-13208/\" slug=\"javi\">   Javi</a>.</p><a href=\"///\"> </a> <h2>Solusandra's Sigil-bearers</h2> The original Sigil-bearers possess a yellow and red colored symbol which very much resembles a Yin-Yang symbol. This Sigil was is the symbol of Solusandra, and is bestowed by her in a seemingly random nature although it is later discovered that she was actually very deliberate in her choosing, if not always wise. Each of these Sigil-bearers have an appointed Mentor, who is actually a splinter aspect of Danik. When Solusandra was cast down following confrontations with her Atlantean peers and Charon of the Negation, Danik took it upon himself to watch over and train her Bearers for the the coming war. <p>Humans granted this symbol are advanced up their personal evolutionary scale as far as possible. This change, though prompted by the Sigil, is genetic and permanent. Even if the Sigil is lost or removed by Solusandra, the Bearers powers are not lost, though they might initially believe so. Over time, the Bearers will regain their powers, and in fact most likely experience a power increase because of their need to relearn the power's use.</p> <p>There are likely more Sigil-bearers existing on worlds across the universe than is known. The following is a listing and summary of the know Sigil-bearers of Solusandra.</p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p> <h3>The Original Five</h3><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13261\" href=\"/samandahl-rey/4005-13261/\" slug=\"samandahl-rey\">Samandahl Rey</a> of Gaia: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and the most important in Danik's plans for the future. Sam's Sigil gave him molecular control over inanimate matter. Sam's Sigil is located on his chest, and looks very much like a burn. Through the Sigil's use, Sam becomes the leader of humanity's fight against the Saurian race (which only sees humans as food to be eaten). Samandahl Rey sires a child with Capricia of Atlantis.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13193\" href=\"/sephie/4005-13193/\" slug=\"sephie\">Sephie</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42971\" href=\"/meridian/4020-42971/\" slug=\"meridian\">   Meridian</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\" slug=\"demetria\">   Demetria</a>: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and potentially one of the most powerful. Sephie's Sigil grants her defensive shielding, repair of organic and inorganic matter, healing of organic matter, flight, and a myriad other abilities. Through the Sigil's use, Sephie begins a crusade against her uncle Ilahn, a cruel despot bent on world (if not universal) domination. Sephie's Sigil is located on her forehead.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-42988\" href=\"/ilahn/4005-42988/\" slug=\"ilahn\">Ilahn</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42972\" href=\"/cadador/4020-42972/\" slug=\"cadador\">   Cadador</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\" slug=\"demetria\">   Demetria</a>: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and one of the most ruthless. Ilahn's abilities included disintegration of matter, energy blasts, self-healing and teleportation. Ilahn is also the first to learn that Sigil bearers can drain the powers/life-forces of the First. Through the Sigil's use, Ilahn strives to solidify his power over the planet, and rid himself of his niece Sephie once and for all. Ilahn's Sigil is located at his throat.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13291\" href=\"/giselle-villard/4005-13291/\" slug=\"giselle-villard\">Giselle Villard</a> of Ciress: One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Giselle's Sigil allowed her to possess all of the spirits of the great masters of her world, and allowed her to perform high-order magic without preparation, material elements, or spells. Through the use of her Sigil, Giselle successfully defends her planet from Animora, an evil First who wishes Ciress as her personal plaything. When Solusandra returned to Giselle to take the Sigil back, Giselle was able to put up fantastic resistance against the goddess, but ultimately failing. Giselle's Sigil is located on her right palm.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-41544\" href=\"/ethan/4005-41544/\" slug=\"ethan\">Ethan</a> of the Heron Dynasty on Avalon: One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Ethan's Sigil grants him the use of a sword of light, as well as multiple defensive abilities and fighting skills, and the ability to heal himself (and later others). Through the Sigil's use, Ethan defends the Herons Dynasty from those in the Raven Dynasty who would see it destroyed, and also successfully creates a free homeland for the Lesser Races. Ethan's Sigil is located on his right bicep.<br/> <br/><h3>Additional Bearers</h3><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13194\" href=\"/brath-mac-garen/4005-13194/\" slug=\"brath-mac-garen\">Brath Mac Garen</a> of Han-Jinn: Brath is a clan leader among the strongest Urelanders clans. He works to unite the myriad clans to better repel invades to their homeland. Brath's Sigil grants him multiple abilities, including personal healing, language translation, and confidence building. Through the use of the Sigil, Brath unites his clans, but is ultimately is captured by the enemy when Solusandra returns to take her Sigil back. Brath's Sigil is located on his chest.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-43085\" href=\"/sara-janning/4005-43085/\" slug=\"sara-janning\">Sara Janning</a> of Yamivol Prime: Sara Janning is an ice miner on the planet Yamivol Prime, far out on the frontier of the Chimera Empire. Sara is in hiding from the Emperor and his family, a dynasty which brought themselves to power through genetic manipulation of their line. Chimera's Emperors have mandated periodic genetic scanning of every inhabitant in a search for genes they can use to take the next step in their family's evolution. Sara has evaded capture since the day she saw her family killed by Chimera forces right before her eyes. That was also the day she was granted her Sigil. Sara's Sigil powers are somewhat esoteric, and don't really manifest themselves until she is fighting for her life against the Emperor who discovers her true nature. Sara's Sigil is located on the small of her back.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13182\" href=\"/mordath/4005-13182/\" slug=\"mordath\">Mordath</a> of Quin: Mordath is an undead human, and the despot conqueror of the Five Lands of Quin. Three-hundred years before when he first tried to conquer the Five Lands, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42951\" href=\"/altwaal/4005-42951/\" slug=\"altwaal\">   Altwaal</a> appeared out of nowhere to end the battle by shooting Mordath through the chest with an explosive arrow. [See: <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43023\" href=\"/altwaals-weapons/4055-43023/\" slug=\"altwaals-weapons\">Altwaal's Weapons</a>] Three centuries later, he is resurrected (but not given full life, only reanimation of an emaciated body) and given a Sigil of power, which he uses to destroy that who stood against him and enslave the remainder of the Five Land's inhabitants. Mordath is likely the most evil and ruthless, and used his Sigil powers nearly exclusively for destruction. Curiously, Modath's Sigil never healed his undead body, and possibly because of his character he never thought to turn his powers inward and attempt such a feat. Mordath's Sigil is located on the top of his head, and is the largest Sigil among all the bearers.<br/><br/>Lindy Karsten (AKA <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53850\" href=\"/radiant/4005-53850/\" slug=\"radiant\">   Radiant</a>) of Heliotrope: Lindy is a designer of high-end MMORPGs for her world. As Radiant, Lindy is the undisputed champion of her world's most popular game (a planet on which it seems EVERYONE plays). Lindy is the first Sigil-bearer to have her mark taken away by its creator, Solusandra. Lindy's Sigil seems to grant her heightened speed and reflexes, giving her a decided edge in the game world. The original location of Lindy's Sigil is unknown, as she always wore a neck to toe gaming suit. However, her suit does have an all-golden version of the Sigil in multiple places.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13202\" href=\"/todosi/4005-13202/\" slug=\"todosi\">Todosi</a> of Han-Jinn: Todosi was a great warrior of his people, the defender of their homeland. When he was granted the Sigil by who he thought was a goddess, he knew he had been touched by destiny. He knew that he had been marked, and that his mark prophesied the fate of his people, but did that fate include victory. Todosi was continually successful in defending his people, until the day the gods appeared. As an \"experiment\" to see if a Sigil-bearer could be killed, one of the First used the Rod of Altwaal [See: <a data-ref-id=\"4055-43023\" href=\"/altwaals-weapons/4055-43023/\" slug=\"altwaals-weapons\">Altwaal's Weapons</a> ] against Todosi, successfully killing him. When Todosi died, his Sigil moved to his brother, who then vowed to kill every god in heaven in revenge. Todosi's Sigil was located on the middle of his back.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13196\" href=\"/obo-san/4005-13196/\" slug=\"obo-san\">Obo-san</a> (AKA Nobuyuki Tsugawa) of Han-Jinn: Obo-san was a devout monk and eschewed all forms of violence. However, he knew that the homeland must be protected, so he lent his wisdom to his brother Todosi, and to the Emperor. When Todosi died at the hands of a god, Obo-san inherited his brother's Sigil, and also came in possession of the very weapon that caused the murder, a weapon he dubbed \"The Weapon of Heaven.\" Obo-san became his homeland's protector in his brother's stead, rejecting his non-violent past, and rejecting the worship of the god as well. He vowed to kill every god in heaven as revenge for the callous murder of his brother. Obo-san Sigil grants him the ability to influence and control other humans with the very words he speaks. Obo-san's Sigil is located on his back, just as it had been on his brother.<br/><br/>Lord Birrema of Courabo: Birrema is the beloved ruler of the world Courabo, a war torn world which is now living in peace because of the efforts of his efforts. Biremma is the first Sigil-bearer approached by Ilahn of Cadador for help against Sephie. Biremma, who is at first distrustful of Ilahn and wants nothing to do with him, is soon swayed when Ilahn promises aid for Courabo's people. When Biremma and Ilahn shake hands on the deal, either they sympathetic telepathy shared between Sigil-bearers does not work, or Ilahn is somehow able to deceive Biremma, or Biremma overlooks Ilahn's nature for the good of his people. Biremma ultimately allows Sephie to defeat him once he learns the real truth of her character. Biremma's Sigil grants him the power to fly, increased fighting prowess, and the ability to create armor, a shield, and a sword, all made of hard light.<br/><br/>Taylor (AKA <a data-ref-id=\"4005-53844\" href=\"/mighty-man/4005-53844/\" slug=\"mighty-man\">   Mighty Man</a>): Taylor's world is one of the first planets to suffer a full scale invasion by Charon and his Negation forces. Taylor has used his Sigil power to assume the role of superhero protector of his planet. Taylor, which is Mighty Man's secret identity, works as a reporter at a major newspaper in a very large city. When the Negation arrives, they attack without warning, vaporizing and entire section of the cities inhabitants with their first strike, leaving only Mighty Man as a survivor. Taylor confronts Evinlea of the First, who is now fighting for Charon. He is quickly defeated, and is questioned by Charon, who is searching for Taylor's mentor, and aspect of Danik. Once they have the information needed, Evinlea blows Mighty Man's head off with a blast of power. As an obvious \"clone\" of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\" href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" slug=\"superman\">   Superman</a>, Mighty Man possesses the same types of powers, but his levels are unknown. Taylor's Sigil was located just below his throat.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-58526\" href=\"/kellra-tuskin/4005-58526/\" slug=\"kellra-tuskin\">Kellra Tuskin</a> of Cardeen: Kellra is Cardeen's leading prognosticator and family/relationship counselor. Kellra is able to see into the future using her Sigil's powers, specifically looking into the coming history of individuals and thereby give them advice to change that future for the better. When Kellra is confronted by Solusandra, she refuses to relinquish her Sigil, and somehow uses her knowledge against the goddess. Kellra is thought to already been highly trained in her vocation well before she gained her Sigil, and that is what guided her ultimate manifestations of powers. Kellra is successful in driving Solusandra mad, making her see visions that cause her to loose all self-control. Solusandra leaves Cardeen without taking back her Sigil.<br/><br/>Neine of the blue-skinned feralfolk: Neine is one of the four Sigil-bearers from various worlds who are co-opted into helping Ilahn of Cadador fight against Sephie. Neine had once served as an agent for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-13246\" href=\"/ingra/4005-13246/\" slug=\"ingra\">   Ingra</a> of the First, fighting at her side at some time in his past. Neine's Sigil seems to grant him increased fighting ability, speed, reflexes, and flexibility as well was flight. Neine is ultimately defeated by Sephie.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-54041\" href=\"/mikos/4005-54041/\" slug=\"mikos\">Mikos</a> of Abyelos: Mikos is a young boy (teenager) who believes his Sigil powers had been given to him as a gift from a deity. At first, Mikos uses his powers to perform simple \"magic\" tricks to impress children, but he soon learned to harness his powers in increasingly growing measure. Soon, the people of Abyelos begin to swamp the boy, begging him to perform miracles in their lives. Eventually Mikos has all he can stand, and he commands them all to stop, which they all do because his emotional outburst causes his power to flare, turning every inhabitant on the planet to statues of crystal. When Solusandra arrives to take away his Sigil, Lindy Karsten convinces her to give him a short amount of time to solve the problem, which he does at just the last moment. Solusandra then takes her Sigil and departs. Mikos's Sigil grants him matter conversion powers, telekinesis, and matter-energy conversion powers. Mikos cries A LOT and possesses a high-level of chemistry and biological knowledge. Mikos's Sigil was located on his forehead, which he always hid with a funky looking piece of *Liefeld-esque* headgear.<br/><br/>Johnny Jumpjet of the Helix Worlds: Not much is known about the hero of the Helix Worlds, Johnny Jumpjet. He is a short, fat, bald guy who wears a rocket-equipped space suit complete with pressurized helmet, even in the perfectly breathable atmosphere a habitable planet. Johnny's Sigil-based powers are unknown. Johnny was one of the first Sigil-bearers recruited by Samandahl Rey for the fight against the Negation. Johnny was last seen about to get his butt kicked by Mordath for asking a stupid question. Johnny's Sigil is located on the left side of his bald head.<br/><br/>Columella the iron goddess: Columella is one of the four Sigil bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie. Columella is known as the iron goddess on her homeworld, but where that is and what her story entails is unknown. She is a savage fighter, and thinks more highly of herself than she really should, since she is easily defeated by Sephie, a girl half her age. Columella apparently worked at sometime in the past for Ingra of the First. Columella's Sigil grants her flight, advanced battle prowess, and other unknown abilities.<br/><br/>Grenang the blacksmith: Grenang is one of the four Sigil-bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie of Meridian. Not much is known about Grenang or his background, other than he is a blacksmith, and holds clan \"etiquette\" in high regard. He comes close to dealing Sephie a mortal blow, and is then disintegrated by Ilahn in anger. Grenang's Sigil granted him the power of flight, blast powers, and other unknown abilities.<br/><br/>Turos of <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42971\" href=\"/meridian/4020-42971/\" slug=\"meridian\">   Meridian</a> on <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42973\" href=\"/demetria/4020-42973/\" slug=\"demetria\">   Demetria</a>: Turos was once the Minister of Meridian, father to Sephie, and brother to Ilahn. He is notable as the shortest lived Sigil-bearer on record, dying only minutes after receiving the mark. Unknown to all, Ilahn had been poisoning his brother, so the stress of the Sigil's empowerment was too much for his weakened constitution to bear. He died, passing the Sigil onto his daughter, Sephie.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13208\" href=\"/javi/4005-13208/\" slug=\"javi\">Javi</a> of Larringa: Javi was a doctor on Larringa who used his Sigil's power to heal. Javi was abducted by Negation agents into the Dark Universe. There he learned he was better able to still access his abilities than any other Sigil-bearer, and also learned he could boost the power of other Sigil-bearers, or members of The First, around him. He is recruited by Evinlea of the First, and is eventually presumed killed at the hands of Negation forces. Buried and left to rot, his Sigil actually keeps him alive and slowly heals his body. He is unearthed by Charon, and pressed into the evil god's service. Being a highly religious man, Javi (after working to destroy him) comes to believe that Charon is the true god and dedicates his life to the mad deity's service. Javi is killed again in a confrontation with Obregon Kaine's resistance group. Javi's Sigil was located on his right forearm.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13213\" href=\"/mercer-drake/4005-13213/\" slug=\"mercer-drake\">Mercer Drake</a> of the Karzath System: Mercer's power is to overcome any physical obstacle to attain a location or object. Back in the Karzath System, Mercer was a pirate and profiteer, using his Sigil abilities for personal gain. Mercer is one of a group of Sigil-bearers who are abducted into the Negation universe and placed under observation on a prison planet. At first, Mercer joins Obregon Kaine's resistance, but eventually departs to essentially find a planet to hide on away from Charon and his minions. Mercer's Sigil is located on his chest.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13214\" href=\"/westin/4005-13214/\" slug=\"westin\"> Westin</a>: Westin has the ability to see how technology is operated, and uses it to help his fellow captives of the Negation escape from Komptin on his prison planet. Later it is revealed that he actually sees backwards in time when he comes in contact with a device. When this happens, he is able to see how the technology was operated before, and then emulates what he sees, sometimes with less than desirable results. At first a member of Obregon Kaine's resistance, he follows Mercer away from the battle.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13206\" href=\"/shassa/4005-13206/\" slug=\"shassa\">Shassa</a>: Shassa's powers enable her to combat any enemy by feeding off portions of their strengths, though it only affects her and does not seem to weaken her opponents in any way. Shassa rarely wins any of her confrontations, leading many to believe she does not truly understand how her powers operate and is too obstinate to ask for aid or training. A member of Obregon Kaine's resistance, she eventually leaves the to follow Mercer's splinter group, ostensibly to \"protect\" those without a Sigil.<br/> <p>Rika the All-Seeing of the Eternal Empire: Not much is known about Rika other than the fact she was tricked into aiding Ingra of the First.<br/></p> <p>Riaglal of Forest: Nearly nothing at all is known of Riaglal but for a name.</p> <p>Unknown Sigil-bearers: Various Sigil-bearers seen throughout the Sigilverse. Most of these Sigil-bearers were recruited by Samandahl Rey by order of Danik to join the fight against Charon and his Negation. The furry, blue-skinned fellow was among those captured by the Negation and taken to their prison planet. He is killed during an escape attempt, proving that Sigil-bearers can be killed, though it is extremely hard to accomplish.</p><h2>Danik's Sigil-Bearers</h2> Danik's Sigil is a glowing, all-orange symbol, oval in general shape with two arms (imitating a spiral galaxy). Danik first granted his Sigil to his best friend from 100,000 years before in Atlantis, Capricia. In turn, he ordered her to choose five more companions to aid her in a sudden battle against monsters from the Negation universe. Atlanteans, having already ascended up the evolutionary scale, already possess a myriad of powers, depending upon what Discipline they chose earlier in their life. Danik's Sigil seems to offer advanced protection and lends focus to the powers they already possess as Atlanteans. <p>In the case of the two humans, Danik's Sigil does not seem to offer evolutionary advancement as Solusandra's does. Here the Sigils allow for increased acuteness for mental and sensory abilities the owner already possesses.<br/><br/></p><p><a href=\"///\"> </a></p> <h3>Atlantean Bearers</h3><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13224\" href=\"/capricia/4005-13224/\" slug=\"capricia\">Capricia</a> of Atlantis: The first of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and another of the most important in his plans. Capricia is an empath, and exhibits shape-changing abilities. Capricia was a student of the Empathy Discipline in Atlantis. Capricia bears the child of Samandahl Rey. Capricia's Sigil rests atop her left breast.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13226\" href=\"/galvan/4005-13226/\" slug=\"galvan\">Galvan</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and twin brother to Gammid. Galvan's abilities allow him to control the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Galvan was a student of the Passion Discipline in Atlantis. Galvan's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13219\" href=\"/gammid/4005-13219/\" slug=\"gammid\">Gammid</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and twin brother to Galvan. Galvan's abilities allow him to control the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gammid was a student of the Passion Discipline in Atlantis. Gammid's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13228\" href=\"/tug/4005-13228/\" slug=\"tug\">Tug</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers. Tug's abilities rest in his mind, allowing him both sharp telepathy and powerful telekinesis. Tug was a student of the Mind Discipline in Atlantis. Tug's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13225\" href=\"/verityn/4005-13225/\" slug=\"verityn\">Verityn</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and the youngest. Verityn's abilities allow him to act as a seer, seeing into both the past and the future. He is also a powerful telepath, and can observe the flow of energy in space and time. Verityn was a student of the Spirit Discipline in Atlantis. Verityn's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"4005-13227\" href=\"/zephyre/4005-13227/\" slug=\"zephyre\">Zephyre</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers. Zephyre's abilities allow her to move with incredible speed. Zephyre as a student of the Body Discipline in Atlantis.

Tens of thousands of years following the Atlanteans, he and a work associate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-43025\" href=\"/appolyon/4005-43025/\" slug=\"appolyon\">   Appolyon</a> ascended, they were ripped into the Negation universe. At first, Charon was temporarily insane, but was nursed back to mental health by Appolyon. In addition, Charon divested himself of his \"bad\" emotions and desires. These in turn became corporeal and self-aware beings of great power, his <a data-ref-id=\"4060-53136\" href=\"/lawbringers/4060-53136/\" slug=\"lawbringers\">   Lawbringers</a>. <p>Charon saw the universe he had entered, and found it in \"chaos.\" The laws of physics worked differently some places than they had in his universe, and might even be subject to change. Using his Lawbringers and the remaining humans who had survived being ripped off the Earth as an army, he embarked on a crusade bring order to the chaos of this universe. He was opposed by Appolyon, but possessing slightly greater power, banished his enemy to a hellish sub-dimension. Charon then set himself up as Emperor of the Negation universe.</p> <p>Ten thousand years later, resistance to Charon's Negation forces is virtually nil, and he turns his eye back out of his universe to the one from which he came. After a short and explosive meeting with Solusandra, Charon has dimensional portals between the universes contructed, and begins slowly infiltrating the Bright universe. Charon gains intelligence on the First and the Sigil-bearers, eventually abducting representatives of each for further study. He begins attempting to graft his own version of the Sigil on his own universe's natural inhabitants, all of which are non-humans. The result are grotesque and disastrous, resulting in horrible deaths for every creature experimented upon. Charon decides to attempt grafting human DNA into his subjects, but the result is even more horrible than previous experiments. When Javi Cobian is dug out of his grave, Charon convinces him to use his powers to heal the grafting subjects long enough for them to live and receive Charon's Ligis.

Many of the Sigil-bearer's stories remain unfinished, and in some cases are quite confusing when comparing the stories in individual publications to the beginning storyline of the Negation War. (For example, Mordath is thought killed by Arwyn in an unofficial script released by Sojourn's writer, but he is seen being recruited by Samandahl Rey at the beginning of the Negation War.)

      "description": "<h2>Women in the Golden Age of Comics</h2><p>The <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age</a> was the time from 1930s to the 1940s and where women developed their role in comics, which would impact later women roles in comics. This time was truly golden for the comics as they had evolved from comic strips though during this era, women in comics weren’t really people with super abilities. These girls’ powers were successful careers, girls who were involved in romance stories or perky teenagers who were dreaming of guys. Comics during this time were developing themes, such as the lone woman taking care of children and filling in her husband’s jobs (think World War II).</p><p>Comics were also discovering new genres, like romance, action, mystery and crime, humor and teen-themed. The diversity was dwindling during the 50s because new mediums of entertainment were being invented. For example, the radio was very popular as radio was a free way of getting their daily dose of fiction. The fact the Dr. Fredric Wertham’s book Seduction of the Innocents was released had accused comics for being responsible for the anti-social behavior. In reaction to that, the Comics Code was imposed, and thus began the dwindling of sales regarding comics. However, there were three types of characters for women in comics and they were:</p><h3><b>Career Orientated Girls</b></h3><p>With the use of women in comics during the Golden Age, the career-type character were usually females looking for work, but not work that women usually did during World War I. Instead of making weapons for the war effort, they would be portrayed as looking for work as a secretary, nurse or sometimes a teacher. Such characters were Millie the Model and Nellie the Nurse. Women looking for work as a secretary etc. was quite a big thing, as being employed was one thing, being paid the same rate as men was another.</p><h3>Romantic Role</h3><p>The second role, which was the romance archetype, had two roles. They could either be the Bad or Good Girl.</p><ul><li>The Good Girl would usually have their heart broken or end up in a true romantic relationship.</li><li>The Bad Girl always broke the boys’ hearts.</li></ul><p>Plots involved with these characters could either that the Good Girl finds true love and gets married while the Bad Girl tries to be good, but fails and goes back to her wild ways.</p><h3>Perky Teenager Role</h3><p>The perky teenager roles were taken by characters such as <a href=\"/betty/4050-11037/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11037\">Betty</a> and <a href=\"/veronica-lodge/4005-2843/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2843\">Veronica</a> from the <a href=\"/archie-comics/4050-1898/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1898\">Archie comics</a>. They could be fun-loving and crazy teenagers (and sometimes stupid) as both of them spent all their time fighting over Archie. <a href=\"/josie/4050-11906/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11906\">Josie</a> from <a href=\"/josie-and-the-pussycats/4060-56774/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56774\">Josie and the Pussycats</a> was also like this, involving her bands in strange adventures but always making it through.</p><h2>Women as Superheroes in Comics</h2><p>The first known female superhero was a minor character called <a href=\"/fantomah/4005-2627/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2627\">Fantomah</a> by writer/artist <a href=\"/fletcher-hanks/4040-56582/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-56582\">Fletcher Hanks</a>. Fantomah was an immortal Egyptian woman who could turn into a skull-faced creature with superpowers who would fight evil. Her first appearance was in Fiction House’s <i><a href=\"/jungle-comics-/4000-126016/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-126016\">Jungle Comics</a></i> <a href=\"/jungle-comics-/4000-126016/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-126016\">#2</a> which was released in February 1940. Another character who was highly influential was <a href=\"/invisible-scarlet-oneil/4005-61051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61051\">Invisible Scarlet O'Neil</a> who fought crime using the power of invisibility and debuted on June 3, 1940 in a newspaper comic strip. Antiheroes were also used, as <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-9559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9559\">Black Widow</a> (not to be confused with <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Marvel’s Black Widow</a>) who was an emissary of <a href=\"/satan/4005-21893/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21893\">Satan</a> and killed criminals and sent them back to Hell. A popular female superhero was <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> who was created by <a href=\"/william-moulton-marston/4040-43411/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43411\">William Moulton Marston</a> and his wife <a href=\"/elizabeth-holloway-marston/4040-55785/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-55785\">Elizabeth</a> and she debuted in <i><a href=\"/all-star-comics-/4000-116412/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-116412\">All Star Comics #8</a></i>. He created Wonder Woman because he wanted a positive role model for girls around the world as he wrote in an article about comic books:</p><blockquote><p>\"America's woman of tomorrow should be made the hero of a new type of comic strip. By this, I mean a character with all the allure of an attractive woman, but with the strength also of a powerful man. There isn't enough love in the male organism to run this planet peacefully. What women presently lack is the dominance or self-assertive power to put over and enforce her love diaries. I have given Wonder Woman this dominant force, but kept her loving. It is my hope to make this strip as appealing to adults as it has proved to kids.”</p></blockquote><p>Marston was the writer for the first Wonder Woman comics, and he had written her as a woman with natural leadership skills, though he had always portrayed them with the themes of bondage. In one issue, she went mad because her bracelets had been broken, and the bracelets represented restraint and said that “power without self-control tears a girl to pieces.”</p><p>The World War II theme was fading away and publishers wanted to appeal to a wider variety of audiences. Since Wonder Woman, there would be <a href=\"/miss-america/4005-31887/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31887\">Miss America</a>, <a href=\"/sun-girl/4005-36454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-36454\">Sun Girl</a>, <a href=\"/blonde-phantom/4005-41880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41880\">Blonde Phantom</a>, the revival of <a href=\"/phantom-lady/4005-11239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11239\">Phantom Lady</a> and <a href=\"/black-canary/4005-1689/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1689\">Black Canary</a>. Female characters in comics then started wearing costumes such as the <a href=\"/woman-in-red/4005-6231/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6231\">Woman in Red</a>, who was a police officer and the <a href=\"/phantom-lady/4005-11239/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11239\">Phantom Lady</a>, who wore a green (and then red) cape. During World War II, women had to take up jobs that were usually taken up by men, such as arms making, truck driving and welders. The reason why women were employed to take up these jobs was because of the war effort. Women wouldn’t have originally been able to take up these jobs. Once the men returned home from war, the women refused to give up this, as they felt having a job was liberating and this created very vague definitions of masculinity and femininity. This new type of role in women created the 'femme fatale', who was a sexually aggressive woman. One such example is a comic character called The Spirit. She was someone who always wanted to avenge herself by the means of blackmail.</p><h2>Women in the Silver Age of Comics</h2><p><a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">The Silver Age</a>’s time frames were the 60s and the 70s and a popular comic genre was romance comics. During this time, were published that if you liked one, you would stick to it. If you wanted a classic 40s feel of superheroes, you were with DC, and if you wanted fast-paced action, you were with Marvel. There were still comics being published this time that could have been published to target girls and women, but few of them were being published by women. The beginning of the 60s would be a renewal of the target audience for comics, as DC had started the ball rolling but would be later known as the Marvel Revolution in 1961 where comics were published specifically for teenage boys.</p><h3>DC Comics</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/981/87040-107139-lois-lane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-87040\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.545\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/981/87040-107139-lois-lane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-87040\"><img alt=\"Its about time...\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></a><figcaption>Its about time...</figcaption></figure><p>After the Comic Code, DC had its own code about women in comics. Here is an example of what was stated: “The inclusion of females in stories is specifically discouraged. Women, when used in plot structure, should be secondary in importance, and should be drawn realistically, without exaggeration of feminine physical qualities.”</p><p>During the Silver Age, women always had some kind of connection with the hero’s alter ego. For example, <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> worked with Clark Kent (<a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>). Carol Ferris (<a href=\"/star-sapphire/4005-5698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5698\">Star Sapphire</a>) was <a href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern</a>’s boss and<a href=\"/iris-west/4005-46069/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46069\">Iris West</a> was the on-off girlfriend of <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a>’s alter ego, <a href=\"/barry-allen/4005-22804/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22804\">Barry Allen</a>. Even when Wonder Woman was starting out she wasn't very popular at first during her comics but when she became an animated character she wasn't taken very seriously. In the Super Friends her main job was to use the <a href=\"/wonder-womans-invisible-plane/4055-43539/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-43539\">Invisible Jet</a> to take the men to their destinations.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175140\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2549019607843\" data-width=\"204\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 204px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-175140\"><img alt=\"to change the roles!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane.jpg 204w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px\" data-width=\"204\"></a><figcaption>to change the roles!</figcaption></figure><p>In the 1950s, Batman’s character family would expand. That would be the popular beginnings for such characters like <a href=\"/ace-the-bat-hound/4005-31302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31302\">Ace The Bat-Hound</a>, but two female characters would join: <a href=\"/vicki-vale/4005-8264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8264\">Vicki Vale</a>, who was basically <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a> and <a href=\"/batwoman/4005-9052/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9052\">Batwoman</a>. She burst onto the scene during the 50s also known as <a href=\"/batgirl/4005-1701/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1701\">Kathy Kane</a> and the first response she gets from a male bad guy is “Ha-ha! What can she do?” Another super heroine called the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a> was someone on a motorbike, and there also many lines of what feminists would call sexist.</p><blockquote><p>Burglar: \"There’s only two of them. The girl doesn’t count.”</p><p>Robin: \"A girl saving you? It’s ridiculous!”</p><p>Batman: \"This is no place for a girl.”</p><p>Batwoman: \"How could any woman ever equal the great Batman?”</p></blockquote><p>Another prominent female character was <a href=\"/carol-ferris/4005-18276/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18276\">Carol Ferris</a> who played <a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a>’s (Green Lantern) boss. This was quite different, as the woman was in charge of the man. Hal Jordan tried many times to date her, but she rejected his advances and she always thought of business first as quoted here from Showcase #22 in 1959.</p><p>\"You heard what dad said. I've got to satisfy his faith in me - and that means that during the next two years, I'll have absolutely no time for romance! I'm your boss Hal Jordan and that's orders.\"</p><p>Ferris was also a superheroine and took up the role of Star Sapphire to fight Green Lantern. A strategy she planned was to weaken Green Lantern so much that she would then propose to him. Star Sapphire unmakes Green Lantern, and he promises to marry her. With his ring, he reads her mind and realizes that she is Carol Fenris. He then erases her mind so that he can put off the marriage.</p><h3>Marvel Comics</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-510998\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-510998\"><img alt=\"Marvel's First: Invisible Girl\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg 500w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Marvel's First: Invisible Girl\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Marvel's First: Invisible Girl</figcaption></figure><p>When Atlas Comics became Marvel Comics, the use of women in comics were more common and one of the first ones to be used was the Susan Storm, better known as Invisible Girl (or <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>) from the<a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. Most of the time, the female roles were powerful ones but were usually influential in terms of evil. For example, the <a href=\"/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a> would always romantically advance with <a href=\"/hank-pym/2247/\" data-ref-id=\"2247\">Henry Pym</a>, but he would always reject her advances as he had a very fatherly tone.

In Howard the Duck, Beverly talks Howard out of committing suicide and she is much like a mother towards Howard as his friendship with her was invaluable, helping him to cope of Earth because of that. Jennifer was made a prominent role, because she was the only human on Earth who had a psychic connection with Man-Thing.</p><p>Even though they both have strong roles, they are still portrayed as sex objects and victims. For example, Beverly makes ends meet by posing nude and her beauty usually gets her into trouble, one example is being capture by Dr. Bong who was obsessed with her during their teen years. This obsession allows Dr. Bong crave her even more and he soon wants to marry her and she marries him anyway in order to save Howard. Beverly was also captured by a sheik and Howard must save her. With Jennifer, she steals an enchanted book and accidentally summons a demon. Man-Thing manages to rescue her, and Jennifer manages to burn the book.

Where the Bad Girls were mainly portrayed as women with attitude, Good Girls could be seen as having a strong spirit. Where the Bad Girls dress with revealing clothing, the Good Girls dress with the provocative sexiness of the 40s. The Bad Girls were usually avengers (much like the super villain archetype) and the Good Girls were adventuresses, heroines, sidekicks or girls who just happen to find trouble in their wake. Most of the Good Girls were usually super heroines, but also came from other genres.</p><p>Examples of the Good Girls were Lady Luck and the Phantom Lady. Another example of a Good Girl was Sheena, who was created in 1937 where she was to do a knock-off with Tarzan. But rather than doing a knock-off, she was then included in Tarzan’s storylines where she took the lead role. Her character was artistic, beautiful and smart and was a natural leader. She rescued men and had a male sidekick. Basically, it was the other way around.</p><p>The Phantom Lady also enjoyed being a lead character as a female in comics and was published by two different companies. The Phantom Lady was owned by studio and not the publisher, like many of the spin-offs by Jerry Iger and she was dropped by Quality. Fox bought her and she was in a new costume. With Quality, her costume was a backless yellow leotard with a green cape. With Fox, she wore a blue-halter top and tap pants which were also blue and a red cape. With both companies, she carried a “black light” which was like a flashlight but it projected darkness instead of light. She wore no mask yet she was not unrecognizable by her boyfriend who was a detective. The Fox version of Lady Phantom was drawn by Matt Baker. He had drawn Sky Girl and Mysta of the Moon. He was known to draw them as beautiful, strong and independent and he had lots of detail in them. His characters were glamorous, but also had sense of realism which people could relate to. He also drew Phantom Lady in flat shoes rather than high heels, adding a sense of realism.</p><p>However, Phantom Lady’s was infamous at one point, due to Dr. Frederic Wertham use, as he used her comic covers as an example of sexual bondage in his book Seduction of the Innocent though it is true that she is tied up thanks to Matt Baker’s art. In comics, there is always conflict between the good and the evil. The good always defeats the evil, though if that is so, then the suspense and adventure is lost, so, the villain must win sometimes to keep the story going. So, for the evil to win, they must somehow capture the good guy, as opposed to killing the good guy which will obviously end the story. Seeing as anything involved with a woman must be sexual subconsciously, her confinement is bondage. If the villain had beaten her, it would be considered “graphic sexual violence” and if the villain was a woman, the bondage or sexual violence becomes lesbian bondage.</p><p>In the case of art, the Good Girl had a great deal of sex appeal with the women featured, but the view of these comics which has been portrayed as sexy would perhaps be the views from its readers, which can be compared below.</p><p>Looking at the first picture of Phantom Lady, it is revealing, but compared to the second one it is not much. With this picture, there is no cleavage what-so-ever and half of the both of her thighs are covered up.</p><p>It is more revealing here and this is much sexier than the first one and the second one is usually used in modern comics today where the cover is spiced up than they are portrayed in the comic themselves. There is cleavage showing and a bit has been cut out on the sides of her body. There are also slits on her very short skirt. On the cover, there is also rope tied around her wrist, again, making a reference to the confinement of women in comics and how it is usually portrayed.</p><p>The third picture, it is even skimpier with a V-neck that plunges all the way down to her waste and her bottom half of clothing is almost like a piece of cloth.</p><p>However, the portrayal and popularity of Good Girls was due to the fact of the audience where they were a wide variety of people, where in the modern comics, the majority of the audience is based on male teenage readers. On the other hand, Lady Phantom wouldn’t have dressed like that if she were only to appeal to female audiences. Other characters like Sheena were created for general audiences as she was an elaboration on the Tarzan theme. She may have been revealing, but then Tarzan himself was just as revealing. When we think of the early 1900s, we usually think where men ruled, but certain characters’ traits made them original and different, such as their man-like strengths and alluring looks. Of course, there were story lines where the woman, who was sexy and alluring, would base her dependency only on the men, where they would have to save them from the villain. Sometimes the hero would receive an award and sometimes usually more than just a reward. But there were also strong portrayals of men and they too were attractive and popular.</p><h3>Bad Girl Role</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212649\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5668789808917\" data-width=\"314\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 314px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-212649\"><img alt=\"Example of Bad Girl Role.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" data-width=\"314\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg 314w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Example of Bad Girl Role.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne.jpg 314w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" data-width=\"314\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Example of Bad Girl Role.</figcaption></figure><p>Come to the 1990s where there was a huge contrast from the 1940s, where the costumes there weren’t as skimpy and revealing, and the woman’s intentions were always good.

Elektra being created in the 80s had ambiguous morals. She was a cold-blooded killer, an assassin yet when she died at the end of her story-arc, readers felt a sense of loss. She was a woman in which Daredevil could love and we could predict the sort of love life she would have. Lots of comic book characters become resurrected, but that would only cheapen Elektra’s come back. So Frank Miller completely did a full blown makeover of her resurrection with a dark ritual in a torn down church and thus bringing the dark aspects of the Bad Girl role. Miller and his team-up with Bill Seinkewitz also brought out the violent aspect of comics. Elektra’s resurrection was seen as something new because the writers used aspects from images and techniques rather than traditional comic book characters. Modern Bad Girls today are perhaps not as innovative today. They may be more profane and excessive, but they have little choices in the directions in which they go.</p><h2>Birds of Prey</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1092263\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5177065767285\" data-width=\"593\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 593px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1092263\"><img alt=\"Birds Of Prey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Birds Of Prey\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/52045/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Birds Of Prey</figcaption></figure><p>DC's Birds of Prey is an all female crime fighting team.

In fact the two are closely related. While Good Girl Art features attractively-drawn (and usually under-dressed) female characters who are sweet or heroic in nature, Bad Girl Art features attractively-drawn (and equally under-dressed) female characters who have dark, scandalous, and violent edges to their personas. Unlike the term Good Girl Art, which once broadly described any form of comic book pinup art featuring sexy girls, the term Bad Girl Art is not as widely used and tends to pertain more specifically to certain characters and publishers. The art form was at its most prevalent during the initial explosion of Bad Girl characters, which reached its peak in the 1990's.</p><p>Common visual characteristics of Bad Girls include elongated and exaggerated physiques, well-endowed busts, long flowing hair, and revealing yet busy costumes resembling bikinis in design. They also tend to carry oversized melee weapons, sometimes bloodied by their defeated enemies. Most, though not all, also possess powers of a supernatural nature.</p><p>It should be noted that most Bad Girl characters are not truly \"bad\" -- that is, villainous and evil in alignment. In fact, the majority of Bad Girls are presented as protagonists who are opposed to true evil. However, in contrast to traditional female superheroes, the personalities and methods of the Bad Girls can be nearly as dark and violent as the evil opponents they battle against. Unlike traditional superheroines, Bad Girls exhibit little or no compunction about maiming or killing enemies.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Precursors</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-6577971\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/6577971-redsonja_vampirella_brereton.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3491525423729\" data-width=\"590\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/6577971-redsonja_vampirella_brereton.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6577971\"><img alt=\"Red Sonja &amp; Vampirella: Early Bad Girl prototypes\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6577971-redsonja_vampirella_brereton.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29837/6577971-redsonja_vampirella_brereton.jpg 590w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6577971-redsonja_vampirella_brereton.jpg 474w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></a><figcaption>Red Sonja &amp; Vampirella: Early Bad Girl prototypes</figcaption></figure><p>The first precursor to the modern Bad Girl appeared more than two decades before the term was coined: The vampire-powered vixen <a href=\"/vampirella/4005-1677/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1677\">Vampirella</a>, who premiered in Warren Comics in 1969.

One of the biggest promoters of the modern genre of Bad Girls was <a href=\"/brian-pulido/4040-44864/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-44864\">Brian Pulido</a>, the founder and writer of <a href=\"/chaos-comics/4010-1864/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1864\">Chaos! Comics</a>, which published a roster that leaned heavily on strong anti-heroine leads. The earliest and most prominent of these was <a href=\"/lady-death/4005-1847/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1847\">Lady Death</a> (created by Pulido and artist <a href=\"/steven-hughes/4040-53349/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-53349\">Steven Hughes</a>), who made her debut in 1992 and is often considered to be the first 'official' Bad Girl in comics. Other popular Chaos Bad Girls were <a href=\"/purgatori/4005-42482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42482\">Purgatori </a>(created in 1994) and <a href=\"/chastity/4005-42487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42487\">Chastity</a> (created in 1995).

Hence team books featuring Bad Girls were rare, even at the height of their popularity when many of them had solo titles. One of the few high-profile 1990's team titles to promote Bad Girl Art was <a href=\"/danger-girl/4060-40975/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40975\">Danger Girl</a>, created by <a href=\"/j-scott-campbell/4040-40772/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40772\">J. Scott Campbell</a> and <a href=\"/andy-hartnell/4040-42731/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42731\">Andy Hartnell</a> in 1998, though the Danger Girls were too 'good' to be true Bad Girls (with the exception of <a href=\"/natalia-kassle/4005-17800/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-17800\">Natalia Kassle</a>, who was revealed to be a traitor to the team).</p><p>Despite the lack of team titles, Bad Girl crossover titles featuring two or more Bad Girl characters (Lady Death/Vampirella, Witchblade/Lady Death, Vampirella/Purgatori, Lady Death/Chastity/Bad Kitty, Glory/Avengelyne, etc) were very popular during this period. In most of these crossover stories the titular Bad Girls got along poorly at first and would often fight each other, until the threat of a common enemy forced them to work together.</p><h3>Recent Era</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-6573072\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.3400402414487\" data-width=\"994\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 994px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6573072\"><img alt=\"Zenescope cover art: Bad Girl Lynessa overpowers Good Girl Dorothy\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" data-width=\"477\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 994w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 716w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 477w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zenescope cover art: Bad Girl Lynessa overpowers Good Girl Dorothy\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 994w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 716w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/29837/6573072-oz_rotwq_02_cover_e_2048x2048.jpg 477w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px\" data-width=\"477\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zenescope cover art: Bad Girl Lynessa overpowers Good Girl Dorothy</figcaption></figure><p>The prominence of Bad Girl Art declined in the 2000's, but the art form continues to maintain a level of popularity and appears to be here to stay. <a href=\"/dynamite-entertainment/4010-1859/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1859\">Dynamite Entertainment</a> has become known for purchasing and reviving many popular Bad Girl characters previously created by other publishers (Red Sonja, Vampirella, Lady Rawhide, and others). In 2010 Dynamite purchased every character in the former Chaos Comics inventory, with the notable exception of Lady Death, who remains the property of creator Brian Pulido (now with <a href=\"/coffin-comics/4010-2077/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-2077\">Coffin Comics</a>). Dynamite hired Tim Seeley (creator of Cassie Hack) to create a new Bad Girl character, <a href=\"/lady-hel/4005-101817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-101817\">Lady Hel</a>, to replace Lady Death in Dynamite's Chaos universe.</p><p>Another significant publisher carrying on the tradition of Bad Girl Art is <a href=\"/zenescope-entertainment/4010-1986/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-1986\">Zenescope Entertainment</a> (the publisher of <a href=\"/grimm-fairy-tales/4050-19824/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19824\">Grimm Fairy Tales</a> and its many spinoffs).

Edgier Zenescope heroines who conform to the true Bad Girl model include <a href=\"/hellchild/4005-127358/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-127358\">Hellchild</a>, <a href=\"/keres/4005-93668/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-93668\">Keres</a>, and <a href=\"/mystere/4005-121328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-121328\">Mystere</a>. Many of Zenescope's villains also tend to fit the Bad Girl archetype; they include <a href=\"/baba-yaga/4005-80427/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80427\">Baba Yaga</a>, <a href=\"/limbo-queen/4005-83002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83002\">Limbo Queen</a>, <a href=\"/queen-of-spades/4005-85071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85071\">Queen of Spades</a>, <a href=\"/venus/4005-85122/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-85122\">Venus</a>, <a href=\"/lynessa/4005-115889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-115889\">Lynessa</a>, and <a href=\"/goblin-queen/4005-76632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76632\">Goblin Queen</a> (not to be confused with the Marvel character of the same name).

      "description": "<h2>Definition</h2><p>Retcon or <strong>retroactive continuity</strong> is a term that is used when writers reveal something new to a previous story already told which usually changes the original back story to something new. The term \"Retroactive Continuity\" was made known by <a href=\"/all-star-squadron/4050-3070/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3070\"><em>All-Star Squadron</em></a> writer <a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a> in the 1980s. Damian Cugley shortened the word to \"Retcon\" when Alan Moore re-wrote the origins of <a href=\"/swamp-thing/4005-15809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15809\">Swamp Thing</a> in 1988.</p><p>At its simplest it can be a piece of information that alters a characters background, shedding some light on their reasoning and at worst a contradiction of a fundamental aspect or plot point of a characters previous established story arcs. The nature of comics to be the amalgam of many artists, writers and even publishers has the obvious flaw of over time their story becoming convoluted and errors and omission are bound to occur and means that ret-con can be as much of a plot device as it can be tool to correct previous errors.</p><h2>List of Retcons</h2><h4>DC Universe related retcons</h4><ul><li><p>In <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/4050-3441/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3441\"><em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em></a>, after all the alternate Earths were destroyed, many heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman had their entire origins retconned and thus their series rebooted.</p></li><li><p>In <a href=\"/infinite-crisis-secret-files/4050-21773/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-21773\"><em>Infinite Crisis: Secret Files</em></a>, there were several retcons that had an on-panel source.

Years after Jean's death, Marvel wanted to bring Jean back. However, bringing her back at first would bring many complications. If Jean were to be brought back, she would still be guilty for killing millions of life forms. Marvel announced that they would not bring back Jean unless someone creates a suitable resurrection story. Kurt Busiek (then a college student) and a few friends started pitching ideas. Eventually he would retcon Phoenix into a cosmic entity, and while Jean was piloting the shuttle, the Phoenix approached her and made an exact duplicate to use. While also merging with a portion of her soul, therefore freeing Jean from the guilt of murder.</li></ul><h4>Wildstorm Universe related retcons</h4><ul><li>After the events of Captain Atom: Armageddon, parts of the WSU were retconned in what was termed a \"soft reboot\", since not everything was erased. The past stories of some teams and characters, most notably Gen 13, Deathblow and WetWorks were completely restarted, erasing all their previous stories (and connections with other teams and characters) from the history of the Wildstorm Universe. Others, like The Authority and Wildcats, were unaffected, and in a few cases, some characters have vague memories of previous connections with characters that they knew before Armageddon but were involved in the retcon. One character, John Lynch, even seems to know that he (and others) are not the original versions of themselves.</li></ul><h3>Supreme related retcons</h3><ul><li>The character Supreme, a Rob Liefeld creation, went through several retcons during its publication.  Alan Moore and later writers have made the character aware of those retcons, which he calls \"revisions\", and had the character meet alternate versions of himself from previous revisions who told him to expect periodic new revisions.  Supreme is currently aware of at least three such revisions (<a href=\"/supreme-41-the-supreme-story-of-the-year-part-1-th/4000-125984/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-125984\">Supreme #41</a>; <a href=\"/supreme-66-the-awakening/4000-351242/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-351242\">Supreme #66</a>; <a href=\"/supreme-blue-rose/4050-75895/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-75895\">Supreme Blue Rose</a>).</li></ul>",

Unlike the other rankings (<a href=\"/marvel-power-rankings/42221/\" data-ref-id=\"42221\"> Marvel</a> and <a href=\"/dc-power-rankings/42222/\" data-ref-id=\"42222\"> DC</a> rankings) it has only the characters that actually appear regularly. This list is not perfect and should be seen more as a guide than anything else. Also, the rankings don't necessarily reflect how characters would fare in a one-on-one fight. The list really only takes into account the general power levels of characters, not necessarily how they would use their powers, so while a very intelligent character might actually be able to beat a more powerful character higher up, that doesn't automatically make them a higher rank. This is a more accurate list than the power rankings but it is still not perfect so take it with a grain of salt.

The characters from different earths now lived together in a clustered earth and changed a lot of concepts (like Superman being the first Superhero of the world), but introduced others new (the legacy hero concept).</p><p>Despite that, the alternate universe continued popping in some fashion or other with Elseworlds tales, imaginary stories, alternate timelines or dreamed realities, with a lot of them resembling previous alternate worlds.</p><h4>Hypertime</h4><p>One prominent effort to do that was the creation of Hypertime by writers <a href=\"/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href=\"/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid</a>, whom wanted to use the successfully Elseworld Kingdom Come as an starting point to bring back the alternate earths and the multiverse but their efforts didn't thrive and the hypertime concept wasn't used beyond some efforts.</p><h3>Post-52 Weeks / The Multiverse:</h3><h4>Infinite Crisis and 52 Weeks: The return of the multiple earths</h4><p>It was Geoff Johns with Infinity Crisis who brought back a glimpse of the previous Multiverse before along with Waid, Morrison and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/greg-rucka/4040-41228/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41228\">Greg Rucka</a> in the weekly 52 brought the concept back in proper fashion, with a multiverse of 52 unexplored universes than resembled strongly the original one from before the crisis but included others as the <a href=\"/kingdom-come/4045-41641/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41641\">Kingdom Come earth</a>, the <a href=\"/wildstorm/4010-708/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-708\">Wildstorm universe</a> and the <a href=\"/earth-9/4015-56464/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56464\">Tangent line</a>.</p><p>During this age multiple earths would be explored and would be used in different stories, as also was hinted the presence of people of other earths living among the characters of the main earth.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / The Multiverse:</h3><h4>Flashpoint</h4><p>However, a new reboot caused after <a href=\"/flashpoint/4045-56280/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56280\">Flashpoint</a>, dubbed <a href=\"/the-new-52/4015-56061/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56061\">the New52</a> changed the multiverse yet again: this time the main earth (re-branded as Prime Earth by <a href=\"/dan-didio/4040-51584/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-51584\">Dan DiDio</a>, DC co-publisher) included the characteristics of the Wildstorm Universe and Vertigo characters. Also <a href=\"/earth-2/4015-56462/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56462\">Earth 2</a> was radically different, with some of the Golden Age characters transformed into a younger generation of heroes in a world in war against Apokolips. Also, now Apokolips and New Genesis exists outside the Orrery of Worlds which contains the 52 known universes</p><p>However the multiverse still has a stronger presence with characters from other universes making pivotal appearances as last seen in <em><a href=\"/forever-evil/4050-67014/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-67014\">Forever Evil</a></em>.</p><h4>Multiversity</h4><p>A more deep exploration of the multiverse has been provided by Grant Morrison in his series <em><a href=\"/multiversity/4045-58028/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-58028\">Multiversity</a></em>. The 52 universes are pretty much similar to their previous incarnation but they have key differences (i.e. the previous version of Earth-40 Pre-Flashpoint, a world of WW2 super agents, is different from the New 52 Earth 40, a world of pulp super-villains).</p><h4>Convergence</h4><p>During <a href=\"/convergence/4045-58251/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-58251\">Convergence</a>, several cities from previous multiverses appeared briefly before being send again to their proper realities. However is implied than the effects of this action in some way affected the multiverse, making it again infinite in the number of earths. However the status of the present existent earths was kept unchanged.</p><h4>Dark Nights Metal</h4><p>A new mystery related to the multiverse has been revealed in <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dark-nights-metal/4050-103508/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-103508\">Dark Nights Metal</a>. When the Justice League investigated the appearance of a mountain in Gotham City, the Blackhawk Squadron explained to the existence of a <strong>\"Dark Multiverse\"</strong>, which is the origin of the mythic Nth Metal of Hawkman. Barbatos, the dark dragon ruling this multiverse, tried and failed to pull the positive matter Multiverse into the dark. Though stopping Barbatos had no known effect on any universes beyond Earth 0, the Justice League's efforts accidentally punched a hole in the Source Wall, exposing the universe to new threats from beyond the Wall's borders and creating new dangers within their universe.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3><strong>Television </strong></h3><h3>CW's The Flash</h3><p>In the second season of CW series The Flash, <strong><em>Jay Garrick</em></strong> made his debut revealing the existence of a parallel universe. The episode, inspired in the classic \"Flash of two worlds\" introduce the concept of multiverse to the series.

      "deck": "Techno-Organic (\"T-O\") is the term for a state of being. It means, roughly, \"Technological Organism\". Most living beings are categorized as organic because they are made of organic material.",
      "description": "<h2>Versions of the Techno-organic Virus</h2><h3>Technarchy</h3><p>One Techno-Organic race is called the Technarchy. The Technarchy is an alien race from a planet called Kvch. Notable members are: <a href=\"/warlock/4005-7223/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7223\"> Warlock</a> and <a href=\"/magus/4005-7336/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7336\"> Magus</a>. The Technarchy used the Transmode virus to turn living beings into techno-organic beings and then would drain them of their energy, leaving the remains of their prey to be nothing more than statues. Those not drained of their energy became a Phalanx. The virus can be transmitted through skin contact, though some mutants aren't over taken by the virus as quickly. Those infected possess the ability to shapeshift, recover from damage, and convert organic matter into convertible sustenance.</p><h3>Phalanx</h3><p>Another Techno-Organic race is The Phalanx. The Phalanx is not a race per definition, just the collective name of any being that has been infected with the Technarchy’s Transmode Virus. Those infected with the Transmode virus lose individuality and usually create a hive like mind and have the the desire to contact other techno-organic lifeforms. Phalanxes also have the ability to absorb both organic and inorganic matter. The danger of phalanx infection is the collective imperative to forming a spire to call the rest of the Technarch race to their designate worlds. In which the Technarch destroy phalanx inhabited planets as a consequence.</p><h4>V.2</h4><p>A radically different yet still similar strain of Phalanx strain was created by the villain <a href=\"/mainspring/4005-7350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7350\">Mainspring</a> while he was experimenting on the mutant T.O infected <a href=\"/hope/4005-7332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7332\">Esperanza Ling</a>. Instead of Techno-Organization of living tissue, this strain was instead dubbed Techno-Mechanization, where the recipient virus strain instead transformed inorganic substance into shapeless mechamatter. <a href=\"/bastion/4005-40568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40568\">Template </a>a subroutine of the mutant killing machine Bastion, would gain vast technoshifting abilities which not only enabled the direct interfacing with machines but to transform and assimilate with it along with computerized systems.</p><h3>Apocalypse</h3><p>Mister Sinister created this strain of the virus to kill Apocalypse, an attempt that failed. Now in Apocalypse's hand he used it to infect Cable when he was only an infant. This versions once required blood contact rather than skin contact to infect someone. The areas that are infected appear as a blue or gray metallic color. They also tend to create protrusions in the infected areas and change form. Infection is quite painful. This version gives normal humans increased attributes such as strength and speed coupled with some form of technopathic abilities.</p><h3>Reaver</h3><p>A new strain of T.O Pathogen was utilized by Apocalypse in the AoA to transform several human acolytes into servants of the aforementioned mutant overlord. One of whom being a clone of <a href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\">Donald Pierce</a> of Earth-295. The Reavers infected with such a virus gained mild bio-mechanical and infection abilities as well as extra extramarital enhancement. Like bionic optics, extendable razor claws, wings for flight, etc.</p><h3>V.2</h3><p>In another broken future placated with programmed hatred of mutant kind. Magneto would find a clutch of individuals infected with what came to be called the Reaver Virus, a horrendous plague that devastated the world 19yrs hence, created by an Artificial Intelligence specialist named Kirk Jansen and his technological manufacturing company. His program would evolve to carry the inherent revulsion towards Homo Superior by mankind. Those whom come under the affliction are twisted into a bionic aberration with some technoshifting capabilities, victims who succumb to the virus sprout heavy mechanical apparatus's such as spider legs, chainsaws and even plasma cannons to aid in tracking and murdering their targets.</p><h3>V.3</h3><p>Within the primary continuum, Bastion had created yet another strain of Reaver Virus code and implanted it within <a href=\"/havok/4005-3546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3546\">Alexander Summers</a> during his time as an <a href=\"/axis/4045-58113/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-58113\">Axis</a> invert. The bigoted and duplicitous <a href=\"/robert-callahan/4005-154801/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-154801\">Robert Callahan</a> sought out this module to enhance the new O*N*E series Sentinel Squad retrofitted using <a href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\">Reaver Tech</a> provided to them by the coerced mercenary force. Pierce and his subordinates learned they could use it's technoforming capabilities to assimilate extra mechanical mass to build and modify new robotic bodies for themselves.</p><h3>Extremis</h3><p>This version of the T-O virus rewrites the carriers entire genetic code. It gives the carriers body an upgrade in health, as well as physical and mental attributes. The original extremis gave powers such as firing electrical bolts, razor claws and breathing fire. Tony Stark would later alter the virus to save his life, in the process it encased his Iron Man within the hollows of his bones and linking his suit to his mind. With the Extremis he can connect to machines all over the world. The one setback he has encountered has been isolationism, a side effect completely opposite to the Transmode Virus.</p><h3><a href=\"/ultimo-virus/4015-56035/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56035\">Ultimo</a></h3><p>Amoral scientists backed by the shady government police force known as <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> were tasked with creating a nanoviral weapon from the remains of a murderous <a href=\"/ultimo/4005-19684/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19684\">alien android</a> and selling it over the black market as a test phase. The Ultimo Virus as it is called has the power to convert most any organic life into an extension of the robot itself. Complete with Superhuman Physical abilities, regeneration and heat vision coupled with a berserker rage; it would affect other biological elements differently bestowing odd aspect of its liquid metal substance onto it it in order for the bearer of its CNS core to move through whatever infected patches of it were in the vicinity. The virus had a conversion and kill rate of 110%, if left unchecked Ultimo could kill off entire planets by morphing plant mater into lifeless metal. Effectivly cutting off air supply and converting worlds into nests of metallic thorns.</p><h3>Necrosha</h3><p>Coupled with <a href=\"/eli-bard/4005-59642/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59642\"> Eli Bard</a>'s ability to infect the Techno-organic virus and <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\"> Selene</a>'s immensely powerful mystical abilities, dead mutants from around the world have been revived under the thrall of Bard and his Black Queen. The pair have raised a zombie like army of homo superior who auto-repair any injuries sustained and have wreaked havoc on the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\"> X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\"> X-Force</a>, the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\"> Emma Frost</a>, and the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\"> Hellfire Club</a>. Those who're revived this way have defunct physiology's; that being they lack the need of sustenance, rest, breathing and the like. They also boast powerful regenerative capabilities.</p><p>Notable revived mutants include <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\"> Rogue</a>'s foster mother and former <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\"> Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a> member <a href=\"/destiny/4005-3557/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3557\"> Destiny</a>, fellow ex-Brotherhood member <a href=\"/pyro/4005-3554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3554\"> Pyro</a>, <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\"> New Mutants</a> member <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\"> Cypher</a>, <a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\"> Warpath</a>'s ex-lover <a href=\"/risque/4005-15551/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15551\"> Risque</a>, the original <a href=\"/thunderbird/4005-2174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2174\"> Thunderbird</a>, <a href=\"/berzerker/4005-30570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30570\">Berzerker </a>of the <a href=\"/morlocks/4060-3191/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\">Morlocks</a>, former X-Man <a href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\"> Banshee</a> and the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\"> Hellfire Club</a>'s protégées the <a href=\"/hellions/4060-3199/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3199\"> Hellions</a>.</p><h3>Operation: Zero Tolerance</h3><p>A nanotech based corrosion which could systematically overwrote human genetic matter, converting living flesh into polymorphous steel and machinery. The intent was the creation of sentinels from fully organic human beings, turning them into <a href=\"/prime-sentinels/4060-57014/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57014\">Prime Sentinels</a>. These cyborg automotons lose all semblance of humanity as a consequence, becoming remorseless killing machines with vast physical augmentation coupled with metamorphic abilities and tracking systems keyed to the X-Gene. The most frightening aspect of the virus was it's hosts ability to inject other people with a nanite inoculation, threatening to transform more people into Prime Sentinels.</p><h3>V.2 Omega Prime</h3><p>A step up from the typical Prime Sentinel was the Omega Prime Sentinel, vastly upgraded machinery compared to prior models. Initially the Omega Sentinels were scrapped due to the technology being too clunky and bulky for practicality.</p><h3>V.3</h3><p><a href=\"/simon-trask/4005-58925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58925\">Simon Trask</a> would seek to galvanize mutant hysteria via his own virus loosely based on the sentinite program. Through it he had the power to first turn people he came in physical contact with, who in turn would infect others with it, into supporters of his anti-mutant agenda. This was made evident by the light blue glow in the eyes of those he'd infected, then those whom had contracted the virus would transform into nonliving cyborg sentinel drones slaved specifically to his command parameters. The augmentations given were ill defined, other than the typical bionic enhancements of super strength, durability, stamina and the capacity to shoot energy beams from their palms.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><p>Seemingly taking after Eliphas and Selene's plans of the T.O Virus. Bastion remolded a Mixed strain of viruses for the personal use of augmenting and resurrecting select human beings with great hatred of the mutant race or for simple tactical usage in his plans for their extermination. Augmenting himself into a powerful nimrod sentinel with celestial tech traits, having combined the Technarchy &amp; Apocalypse strains of the virus to gain even greater technomorphing and roboticizing abilities. Which he used to found his <a href=\"/human-high-council/4060-57422/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57422\">Human High Council</a>, some of whom he would convert those within his thrall into Nimrod Series Omega Prime Sentinels.</p><p>Individuals modified and/or resurrected include <a href=\"/leper-queen/4005-41482/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41482\">Leper Queen </a>underboss of the <a href=\"/mutant-response-division/4060-57513/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57513\">Mutant Response Division</a>, <a href=\"/donald-pierce/4005-3556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3556\">Donald Pierce</a> leader of the <a href=\"/reavers/4060-9726/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-9726\">Reavers</a> and chairperson of the Hellfire Club's <a href=\"/inner-circle/4060-57190/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57190\">inner circle</a>, <a href=\"/william-stryker/4005-40564/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40564\">William Stryker</a> founder of the <a href=\"/purifiers/4060-14915/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14915\">Purifiers</a>, <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/4005-13379/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13379\">Cameron Hodge</a>, <a href=\"/steven-lang/4005-14861/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14861\">Steven Lang</a> and <a href=\"/graydon-creed/4005-13351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13351\">Graydon Creed</a> of the <a href=\"/friends-of-humanity/4060-40563/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40563\">Friends of Humanity</a>. Finally the creator of the Sentinel Program, <a href=\"/larry-trask/4005-10255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10255\">Larry Trask</a>.</p><h3>Ultron</h3><p>During his time alone in the depths of cold space, the malevolent Artificial Intelligence known as <a href=\"/ultron/4005-2242/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2242\">Ultron</a> would eventually take what he knew of the Phalanx's transmode virus and combine it with the technologies of the <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\">Eternals </a>sentient computer system <a href=\"/isaac/4005-22002/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22002\">ISAAC</a>. Ultron would eventually create his own form of T.O Virus named and modeled after his own mechatronics, anyone afflicted with the virus became a subservient hive drone connected to the Ultron mass intelligence as their bodies took on physical characteristics of the monstrous android. Those changed into simulacrum's of the robot become enthralled to him mind, body and soul; as well as gain the capacity to spread and infect countless others across galaxies. Turning them into virus carriers as well. In some infected beings however they gain unique abilities of their own which drowns out the Ultron consciousness's hold on them.</p><h3>Nanocyte</h3><p>In the New 52 productions, the parademon hordes of Apokolips are techno-organic entities created using both the living and dead biomatter from the populaces of worlds that evil gods from Apokolips conquer. Usually the robotic corpse corps snatch up and take all available human, alien or xenobiological entities of inhabited terra's to stationed processing factories for the conversion process. But certain Parademon breeds can also infect solitary individuals with a technocytic virus, in turn, converts individuals into techno-organic soldiers.</p><h4>V.2</h4><p>An <a href=\"/mother-machine/4005-80327/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80327\">individual </a>once taken to a conversion factory to be processed underwent an odd mutation instead due to it's effects. Being transformed into a living, breathing internet hub whose entire physiology had been converted into pure micro-machinery and information. Over the coarse of years, she would come to master her new techno-organic condition spreading her virulent consciousness throughout the internet. Through her technomorphism she could fabricate incredibly advanced pieces of technology and augment the human biome with vast bionic enhancements. Those she infects are able to be resurrected by copying their vital information; their persona's onto her nanocytes in order to regrow them from the atom outwards.</p><h3>O.M.A.C Virus</h3><p>A nanotech virus fashioned by <a href=\"/maxwell-lord/4005-10149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10149\">Maxwell Lord</a> using inert B13 Technology and activates/commandeered through the <a href=\"/brother-eye/4005-51483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51483\">Brother I</a> Satellite system created by <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>. Placated through various immunization, vaccinations and intake supplements supplied to the masses through the localized food chains and sickness treatment facilities. The Virus can be directly beamed into desired hosts via computer equipment or a simple broadband line, aggressively infecting anyone whose contracted the Virus. Once activated the unsuspecting <a href=\"/omacs/4060-57966/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57966\">sleeper agent</a> serves to observe, assess and exterminate all known forms of superhuman activity. Be the individual superpowered or gifted intellects alike. Omactivated subjects gain any manner of unique abilities such as shapeshifting, weapon construction, eye beams and adaptive countermeasures. The hosts share a hive connection to the Brother Eye network and can instantly download any manner of information on the cataloged database of super powered beings on record.</p><h3>Morticoccus Virus</h3><p>A permutation of the Omni Mind And Community nano virus, coming from an alternate future timeline where it is regaled as the most fatalistic sickness known to man. While on his trek through the multiverse during 52; Karate Kid fell prey to the disease and eventually died on Earth-51 looking for a cure to his condition. Morticoccus infection works by first infecting an organism then alternating it's evolutionary cycle. In homo sapiens it first causes them to devolve into feral subhumans with minimal to non-cognizant intelligence while in most faunal forms it has the opposite effect. Initiating a startling change into more articulate creatures whom can read, write and handle heavy machinery; after a fashion. This pathogen was supposedly part of the cause of the <a href=\"/great-disaster/4015-55810/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55810\">Great Disaster</a> which created the Earth A.D. universe.</p><h3>O.T.A.C</h3><p>Also known as the Omniscient Transformational Advanced Cell, a form of full organic techno-virus developed by <a href=\"/silas-stone/4005-27660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27660\">Silas Stone</a>. Initially it was created fort he purpose of creating self aware biological matter that could be re-purposed to affect and heal as well as replace damaged or irregularly formed organic tissue. Curing cancer, blindness, genetic deformities, etc. <a href=\"/anomaly/4005-135459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-135459\">Anomaly</a> a by product of its creation known as O.T.A.C. 13, would utilize it to cause mutagenic phenomena instead of preventing it; creating monstrous cyborg abominations and inducing a cybernization effect. Transforming those who're infected with the O.T.A.C virus into hyper aggressive Mechahuman's who can elongate like taffy, morph limbs into artillery and further spread and infect using O.T.A.C, turning others into Mechahumans as well. The virus was so dangerous that <a href=\"/blue-evans/4005-132953/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-132953\">Blue Evans</a>; a transcendental being from outside of reality, had requested Vic Stone a.k.a. <a href=\"/cyborg/4005-2388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2388\">Cyborg</a>'s aid in halting the progress of which. Having been unleashed in one digital universe that the Digiverse is comprised of, left unchecked it would spread and corrupt the whole of this virtual multiverse until nothing was left untouched.</p><h3>Armor Virus</h3><p>In the newly reinstated comic imprint the alien armor sphere known as <a href=\"/x-o-manowar-armor/4055-56402/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56402\">Shanhara</a> hails from a race of sentient techno-organic <a href=\"/xo-army/4060-61644/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-61644\">armors</a>. Each one carrying a micromechanical infection which both heals and augments their wearers while at the same time, steadily suborns them into a willing thrall of the armor itself. Moreover, those whom the armor takes assimilate more and more of their suits properties as they incurred greater injuries even through the nigh indestructible warsuits. The regenerated appendages and extremities look the same on the outside but within their host, the virus re-constructed limbs carry traces of it's transorganic metallic substance within them. Over time the virus will overtake the host and said individual will become a whole new armor with it's own name and similar abilities to it's symbiotic partner.</p><h3>War/Brass Virus</h3><p>Within another universe where metal and biology are one and the same. Everything and everyone was a steady mix of techno-organic machinery as their natural state of being. But one day a fault within their biomechatronic structure cropped up, giving rise to a hideously lethal T.O. infection. It would seed itself within the very subatomic structure of the host and cause them to morph into a lethal self automated war machine with vast technoforming abilities. Giving the infected incredible amounts of weapon conjuration, equipment fabrication and armor adaptation in order to fight and overcome most any adversary they came across; on top of the natural cyberpathic abilities of those hailing from the transmoded race's dimension. Seeing as Eryx could transmit, mimic and download information from the world wide info-net via tapping into local satellite dishes as well as decode/recode infromation into gleaned knowledge. The only downside was that those infected with the affliction ran the risk of becoming homicidal killing machines whose moral imperatives were psychologically nullified by the viral agent in they're system. Causing them to engage in massacring everything that isn't affected like they are.</p>",

It introduced the Evasion mechanic.</p><p>Superman, Man of Steel</p><p>=======</p><p>The Superman set was a near mirror set of Web of Spider-Man, being that it was the smallest DC set to date and contained nearly the same card codes; Web being MSM, and Superman being DSM.  Superman contained Team Superman, Revnge Squad, New Gods, and Darkseid's Elite, and introduced the Cosmic and Invulnerability mechanics.</p><p>Marvel Knights</p><p>=======</p><p>Marvel Knights was the turning point of VS. and when it truly began to pick up popularity.

All four card types share some common elements:<p>Name: The name of the card.</p><p>Recruit Cost: The ammount of resource points required to recruit a character or equipment.</p><p>Version: This line provides a way to distinguish one version of the character from another (ei. Superman and Spider-Man have many character cards.)</p><p>Team Affiliation: Most characters belong to a team. Some have no Team Affiliation. (ei. Avengers, Spider Friends, Team Superman)</p><p>Flight: Appears on characters who can fly. (They can attack the support row.)</p><p>Range: Appears on characters that have long-ranged attacks. (Characters that have guns, or shoot energy beams from their hands or eyes. They can attack from the support row.)</p><p>Attack Value (ATK): Represents the strength and/or fighting ability of a character.</p><p>Defense Value (DEF): Represents the agility and/or toughness of a character.</p><p>Threshold Cost: Locations and plot twists have threshold costs. You can flip a location or play a plot twist if you have at least as many resources in play as the threshold cost of the location or plot twist. (ei. you may play a plot twist with cost 4 or less if you have 4 resources. You do not have to pay resources to flip locations or play plot twists.</p><p>Card Type: Tells whether the card is an equipment, location, or plot twist. Characters have their team affiliation printed in this spot.</p><p>Ongoing: Appears on plot twists to remind players of an ongoing effect. (An effect that lasts until another effect states otherwise.)</p><p>Flavor Text: A quote or character information that has no game effect.</p><p>Collector Number: The first letters describe the set and the last three numbers describe which card in the set it is. \"Sinister Salvo\" is card 026 in the set MSS (Marvel Spider-Man Starter). A white collector number indicates a common card. When the collector number is silver, it indicates an uncommom card. When the number is gold, it indicates a rare card.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Basic Game Concepts</h2><p>Endurance: Each player starts with 50 endurance. At the end of the turn, if you've knocked your opponent's endurance to zero or less, you win! (This is not totally correct. Whoever has the lowest endurance will lose. If player one has -12 endurance, and player 2 has -23 endurance, player one wins.)</p><p>Deck: The starter set contains two decks of fourty cards to help you learn the game. When building your own constructed deck, you must at least 60 cards.</p><p>Hand: You start the game with four cards drawn off the top of your deck. You then decide whether or not to 'mulligan' this hand. This means that you put those four cards on the bottom of your deck in any order if you do not like the cards you got. You can only do this once, and then you draw four more cards. You then start turn one by each player drawing two cards. You will draw two cards every turn at the start of the Draw Phase, unless an effect tells you otherwise.</p><p>Front Row: When you recruit a character, you can put it in your front row or support row. Characters in your front row comprise your main line of attack and defense. Front row characters protect characters behind them in the support row.</p><p>Support Row: This is the row directly behind the front row where you can place characters. If a support row character is protected (there is a front row character directly in front of it) it can only be attacked by a character with flight.</p><p>Resource Row: This is the row closest to you. Each turn, you may put one card from your hand face down into this row as a resource. Any card can be placed face down into the resource row as a resource. However, plot twists and locations have additional game effects when placed in the resource row. Character and equipment cards put into the resource row may not be turned face up. You can look at face down resources you have in play at any time, but you cannot change their order within the row. </p><p>Protected: A front row character that is not stunned protects the support row character directly behind him. Front row characters are never considered protected.</p><p>KO: Short for 'knocked out'. When a card is KO'd, it is placed into its owner's KO'd pile.</p><p>Ready/Exhausted: A card in play is either ready (upright) or exhausted (turned on it's side, face up). To ready an exhausted card, turn the card upright. To exhaust a ready card, turn it on it's side. Cards enter play in the ready state, unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Stunned: When a character is defeated in combat, it becomes stunned and is turned face down in the exhausted state. Stunned characters may not be attacked and cannot use their powers.</p><p>Recover: When a stunned character is recovered, it is turned face up in the exhausted state.</p><p>Activate: Some cards have the keyword Activate. Only ready (upright) cards can activate. To activate a ready card, exhaust it (turn it to it's side).</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Characters</h2><p>Character cards represent the heroes and villains that make up the Marvel Universe.</p><p>Recruit Cost: You may recruit a character by spending resource points equal to the character's recruit cost. Recruit cost is the number in the top left hand corner in gold.</p><p>Version: Each character has a version immediately under its name. Some characers have different versions that represent various times in the history of that character. You can have up to four copies of each version in your deck.</p><p>Unique: Most characters are unique. Each player may have only one copy of a named character in play at a time, regardless of the character's version. When you recruit a character, put any other characters you control with the same name into your KO'ed pile. For example, each player could have own copy of Spider-Man in play, but only one copy.</p><p>Army: A few characters have \"Army\" printed in the version area underneath their name. These characters are not unique. Each player can have any number of army characters in play at the same time. These characters represent agents, soldiers, or minions of a larger organization. When building a deck, you can include unlimited copies of army characters.</p><p>Flight: A front row character with flight can bypass an opposing front row character to attack the protected character behind it.</p><p>Range: Characters with range can attack from the support row. A character with both flight and range can make an attack against a protected character, even while in the support row!</p><p>Attack Value: A character's attack value represents the character's ability to fight. The attack value is abbreviated \"ATK\" and is printed in gold next to the lightning bolt icon in the bottom left corner of the card.</p><p>Defense Value: A character's defense value represents the character's resistance to attack. The defense value is abbreviated \"DEF\" and is printed in silver next to the shield icon in the bottom left hand corner of the card.</p><p>Team Affiliation: Most characters are part of a team and can rienforce their fellow teammates and combine with them for team attacks. If no name appears here, the character is not a member of a team.</p><p>Team Symbole: Now on each character is also a Team Symbole, this Symbole will be used as a refrence for this character's team affiliation. Character's without an affiliation do not of a symbole.</p><p>Concealed: There is a moon shape symbole colored in on the character. This means that the character will come into play in the concealed area.</p><p>Visible: The sun is colored in on this character. This means that the character will come into play in the visible area.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Equipment cards represent gear, weapons, and vehicles that your characters can use. </p><p>Recruit Cost: Just like a character card, you may recruit an equipment card during the recruit step by spending resource points equal to the number of the equipment's recruit cost. (Most equipment have a cost of 0.)</p><p>Equip Restrictions: A character may not be equipped with more than one equipment card at a time. You cannot move the equipment between characters. You may only equip characters that you control.</p><p>KO: When a character is KO'd or removed from play, any equipment attached to the character is placed in it's owner's KO'd pile.</p><p>Unique: A few equipment cards are unique and follow the same rules as unique characters. Look for the word \"unique\" in the text box.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Locations</h2><p>Locations are important places in the Marvel Universe. Locations are put face down in the resource row and may only be flipped face up from the resource row. You may place only one card into the resource row each turn. When you have a face down location in your resource row you may flip it over to make its game text active. Once it's flipped up, it may not be turned face down again.</p><p>Threshold Cost: The silver number in the upper left corner of the card represents the minimum number of resources that must be in your resource row for you to flip the location. Usually, the number is very low, but some powerful cards have a higher threshold cost. </p><p>Using Threshold: Once you've met a location's threshold cost, you may flip it face up at any time. You may flip face up as many locations as you want, as long as you've met each one's threshold cost. You do not have to spend resource points to flip a location.</p><p>Stay in Play: After a location is turned face up, it stays in play and continues to count as a resource every turn. Most locations have powers that can be activated or provide continuing modifiers to the game.</p><p>Unique: Like characters, locations are unique. When you flip a location, place any other location you control with the same name into your KO'd pile.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Plot Twists</h2><p>Plot Twists are surprise situations that affect the game or teh characters within it. Plot twists can be played from your resource row like locations or they can be played directly from your hand. Plot twists are never unique, you may have several copies of the same plot twist in play at the same time.</p><p>Play from Resource Row: You may play a plot twist from your resource row at any time as long as you have a number of resources equal to or greater than the threshold cost of the plot twist. Turn the card face up and follow the instructions on the card. Leave the plot twist in play; it continues to count as a resource, but doesn't do anything else unless it has an ongoing power.</p><p>Stay in Play: Like locations, plot twists stay in play after they are used. Most plot twists provide a one-time modifier, but they remain in play afterword, functioning as a resource. They may not be turned face down.</p><p>Play from Hand: You may also play a plot twist from your hand at any time as long as you have a number of resources in play equal to or greater than the threshold cost of the plot twist. Show the plot twist to the other players and follow the instructions on the card. Then put the plot twist in your KO'd pile instead of your resource row.</p><p>Ongoing: Ongoing plot twists have the ongoing icon and continue to have active powers when they are face up in your resource row. Play an ongoing plot twist as normal following any instructions before the word \"Ongoing.\" Any game text after the word \"ongoing\" starts to work as soon as the plot twist is turned face up and continues to work as long as the plot twist remains face up in your resource row.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Starting the Game</h2><p>Each player will need a way to track his endurance (pen and paper, dice, calculator). At the start of the game, randomly determine which player chooses who has the initiative for the first turn. Flip a coin, roll a die, or play rock-paper-scissors - the winner gets to choose who starts with initiative on turn one. Players shuffle their decks and give their opponent a chance to cut it. Then, each player draws an opening hand of four cards.</p><p>New Hand (Mulligan): If a player is unhappy with his opening hand of four cards, he may immediately place the cards on the bottom of his deck in any order and redraw four new cards. Each player may do this only once per game, only at the start of the game.</p><p>Turns and Initiative: A game of Marvel is played in turns, phases, and steps. During a turn, players can put resources into play, recruit characters, and fight battles. One player will begin the turn with the initiative. That player is able to perform his steps first that turn.</p><p>Initiative Token: When playing the game for the first few times, you should use a token to track which player has the initiative. The token can be anything handy; a coin, a die, or Captain America's shield. At the end of the turn, pass the initiative token clockwise to the next player.</p><p>Object of the game: Each player starts with fifty endurance, which represents the staying power of that player's team of heroes. The object of the game is to reduce your opponent's endurance to zero.</p><p>Special Note: If at any time you run out of cards in your deck you do not lose. You can continue playing; you just no longer draw any new cards.</p><p>The Golden Rule: Whenever a card contradicts a rule in this rulebook, the card is correct.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Turn Sequence</h2><p>Draw Phase: During the draw phase, all players simultaneously draw two cards.</p><p>Build Phase: The player with the initiative performs the three steps below in order. Then the next player completes the three steps in order until each player has completed all three steps of the build phase.</p><p>Resource Step: You may choose any one card from your hand to put into your resource row face down as a resource. Place the card to the right of the last resource you put in into play. (It is no common to place the resource the the left, starting with the first resource next to your deck, and continuing in a line to the left.) Any characters or equipment placed into the resource row may never be turned face up. (The new key word \"reservist\" allows you to recruit characters that have reservist from the resource row.)</p><p>Recruit Step: At the start of your recruit step, each card in your resource row generates one resource point. You can spend resource points to recruit characters and equipment. Any unspent resource points are lost at the end of the recruit step. To recruit a character or equipment, you must spend a number of resource points equal to the card's recruit cost. You can place a newly </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-116685\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1165048543689\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-116685\"><img alt=\"Card Formation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" data-width=\"206\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG 206w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Card Formation\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system.JPG 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 206px) 100vw, 206px\" data-width=\"206\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Card Formation</figcaption></figure>recruited character face up into either your front row or support row.

They attack one at a time.</p><p>Declaring an attack: Choose one of your ready front row characters to be the attacker and an opposing unprotected character to be the defender. An unprotected character is a character in the front row or a defender in the support row with no character in front of it. Exhaust the declared attacker to begin the attack. </p><p>Characters with flight: Normally, a character can only attack an opposing unprotected character. However, characters with flight can fly over a front row character to attack a protected character behind it. (Contrary to beginer belief, characters with flight cannot 'fly' over a front row character and attack a player directly if there are no support row characters.)</p><p>Characters with Range: Normally, support row characters cannot attack. However, a character with range can attack from the support row.</p><p>Characters with Flight and Range: The ultimate combination. A character with flight and range can attack from your support row and into either row.</p><p>Resolving and Attack: </p> <li><p>Compare the attacker's ATK to the defender's DEF. If the attacker's ATK is less than the defender's DEF, nothing happens to the defender. If the attacker's ATK is equal to or higher than the defender's DEF, the defender will be stunned. If the attacker's ATK is greater than the defender's DEF, the defender will be stunned and it's controller will take breakthrough endurance loss equal to the difference.</p> </li> <li><p>Compare the defender's ATK to the attacker's DEF.

The character is then turned face down in the exhausted state. A stunned character remains in the row and column that it occupies, but no longer protects a support row character immediatly behind it. A stunned character still counts as a character and retains its name, version, and team. A stunned character cannot ready, cannot be attacked, and its game text is inactive. Any player may look at any stunned character at any time. <p>Breakthrough Endurance Loss: When an attacker's ATK is greater than a defender's DEF, the defender's controller loses endurance equal to the difference between the values.</p><p>Attacking an Opponent Directly: If an opponent controls no characters or if all of his characters are stunned, you can attack his endurance directly. Declare an attack as normal, but since there is no defender, simply subtract the attacker's ATK from the opposing player's endurance. This is considered breakthrough endurance loss. Your attacks must still be legal in order to make this attack.</p>",

It was first mentioned in the Uncanny X-men #141  when Moria MacTaggert suggest that Senator Robert Kelly has suggested that mutants must be registered under law by the government.  The law does eventually go under way and is made clear when Senator Kelly is discussing  the introduction of the law with a colleague. Later, in Uncanny X-men# 183 the Act is made as a passed legalisation and in 188# it becomes an accepted law. <br/> <br/>The Mutant Registration Act did not have any major impact on the story lines in the Marvel Comics, but it was part of some of the plots. This law is what motivated Cyclops and Jean Grey to form the original X-Factor group and it was one of the reasons Valerie Cooper and Mystique formed the Freedom Force. </p>",

      "description": "<p><b><u>Note</u>: When possible when adding the homage cover concept to a specific issue, add a description of what it is a homage to in the description box on the issue page.</b></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The cover of a comic book is created to draw attention, and it is usually up to the artist to create a striking image to entice the customer to purchase the comic. Sometimes, the cover art on a particular issue becomes so iconic that other cover artists feel that they must pay tribute by making their own version of the image. This is an introduction to many different poses and styles that have been paid homage to over the years.</p><h2>Homage Covers</h2><p>The largest portion of covers that pay homage are usually honouring the work of previous comic book covers. They tend to be direct tributes, although occasionally there are unintentionally alike covers. One should note that there are really only so many interesting poses the human body can make, and it's not out of the question that in some cases what appears to be a tribute may just be a coincidence.

However, those two issues are listed since they are two of the most recognizable homages. It is probably impossible to determine which was the very first 'carrying a dead loved one' as there's not that many ways to stand with a dead person in your arms.

It has even become popular to use homage covers through story arcs and even through a whole volume.

      "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>One day it occurred to comic book writer <a href=\"../../gail-simone/26-41294/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gail Simone</a> that women in comics are so commonly misused to define a story after one of her favorite female characters was killed off. She decided to call this term 'Women in Refrigerators' after a panel in the <a href=\"../../comic/green-lantern/4363/39462/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Green Lantern #54</a> (1994) comic book. The scene in question featured <a href=\"../../kyle-rayner/29-40431/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kyle Rayner</a> returning home to his apartment. There he found a note informing him to look inside the fridge, where he found the mangled remains of his girlfriend, <a href=\"../../alexandra-dewitt/29-41167/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alex DeWitt</a>.

      "description": "<p>Though not common, there have been round robins in comics. Before they start their round robin, the people involved have to agree on some guidelines for their round robin \"story.\" These can be, but are not necessarily limited to: amount contributed, plot, characters, style, continuity, goals, what to do about was previously created, time constraints, things not allowed, specific rules, etc. </p> To be more interesting, usually comic round robins have different writers - sometimes the writers are also the artists. Sometimes they have different artists, especially if they want the \"look at all the people involved\" sort of effect. With three or more writers, there is the question of whether a writer somewhere in the middle can only read the last entry (and since they don't have access to the previous entries, the story becomes very \"schizophrenic\") or all the work previously made (making for a more coherent story). It is sometimes the duty for the last writer with the overwhelming task of \"wrapping things up,\" or everyone involved can get together to finish the project, or it can just be left hanging, maybe for someone else to continue. Also everyone is usually given a chance to see, and possibly have a good laugh over, the \"completed\" work.<p>Here are some examples of Round Robins in comics:</p><p>DC Challenge: a 12 part round robin in the DC universe with 12 different writer/artist teams. Each were required to make a cliffhanger for the next team to solve and there was no writer collaboration, except in the last issue, where it was wrapped up.</p><p>3 Word Game (In the Comicvine forum under RPG's): Well, okay this isn't a comic. I put this on to show an example of a round robin, for readers who don't have any round robin comic issues. This is a story where anyone can add three words to it. They have the opportunity to read all the previous entries (whether they do or not...) and to post another 3 words, if they desire. Probably not very cohesive. At least for now, it seems never ending.</p>",

      "deck": "Were you enjoying a comic book series until suddenly it changes for the worse, and it is no longer as good as it once was and is in serious decline? Well then, that series has \"jumped the shark.\"",
      "description": "<h3>Note: Don't attach this concept to issues since it's highly opinionated.</h3><p>The term \"jumping the shark\" came from a Happy Days episode in which <a data-ref-id=\"4005-62138\" href=\"/the-fonz/4005-62138/\" slug=\"the-fonz\">the Fonz</a>, while water skiing, had to jump over a shark. Many viewers found it illogical to Fonz's character and rather stupid. People were also finding that the quality of the shows after that were in a decline. In order for something to be jumping the shark in any medium, there has to be something specific that happens in the series that watermarks (get it?) the end of that series being good. People are usually forever changed as to their opinions of that series afterwards. It isn't \"jumping the shark\" if the series slowly declines and nobody can put a finger on it as to why it's that way, nor is it if the series has a bad episode, but with good episodes after it, and the bad episode is forgiven.</p><p>Like any serial medium, comics is rife with opportunity for jumping the shark. Listed are certain ways that a comic series that jumps the shark. These reasons aren't exclusive, sometimes, it's more than one factor which makes the title jump the shark.</p><p>Artists/writers leaving or introduction of new writers or artists. Sometimes a series has a fantastic team: great writing, great artwork, etc. Then suddenly someone new comes in, and that series is on a one way trip to Sucksburg. Or sometimes there's a team of artists or writers, and someone leaves that team (and nobody replaces them) and it's apparent where the talent was. Within a few issues a comic can go from awesome to so bad, you wonder how the ink stays on the paper.</p><p>A character entering or leaving the series. Since comics are character driven, they are very important to the story. Sometimes changing the formula as to who is in or out of the storyline can be disastrous. Characters can leave the series for many reasons like death or disagreement with other characters. The character leaving can make the comic bad, especially if he is a fan favorite or about the only thing holding the series together. For introducing a character, the character usually has to be nonfitting to the story, irritating or otherwise make the comic unreadable (boring characters introduced are usually just ignored and aren't usually jump the sharkworthy). Sometimes it's not the hero characters, but the villain characters that are bad (not just evil). People want this usually shoehorned in character to die soon and painfully. One of the most famous examples (although this is a cartoon) is Scrappy Doo.</p><p>The plot becomes absurd, silly, stupid, etc. A lot of times, the people behind the comic want to take the comic in a new direction. The problem is it's a bad direction. Or they used their good ideas up first, so now its time for the not so good ideas. Sometimes they paint themselves in corners, and judging from what they're doing, they've been sniffing the fumes. Although there may not be a specific panel that people can draw on and say \"everything before this panel was good, everything after this panel was bad,\" when a story arc is mentioned only in angry or dejected or \"those were the good days and this isn't\" tones, that comic may have jumped the shark.</p><p>They run out of ideas or are treading water. Although closely related to the last paragraph, this deserves special mention. Sometimes it's not the ideas or characters or whatever is what's bad, it's the fact that they're using them over and over again. Long running series can have the been there done that feel to them (though at which point people think it jumps the shark can vary - is it because of this villain introduced for the 8th or 9th time that pushes it over the edge to baddom for that person?). Or the plots are near carbon copies of each other. It's hard to tell, except maybe by later interviews, if the team just liked doing the same thing over and over or they actually ran out of ideas, but were forced to create something.</p><p>Outside influences. Sometimes the creators have good ideas and would continue to make a great comic, but something outside the team is stopping them. One big example would be the publishers. Sometimes the bigwigs in charge want the comic to change. And who better than people who sit in an office all day would know how to make a good comic? Sometimes it's a censorship issue, and the comic had to be toned down; but if the title was over the top, and it had to be brought a few notches down, it's no longer top-notch, is it? Or they think the comic should go in this direction, or should have this new character, or should be part of this big crossover. Sometimes its due to the comic getting a new publisher, and all the problems with it. Sometimes, a comic isn't selling well, but it's still a good comic. So ways of improving sales are thought up at the board meeting. Changes are coerced (\"do this or we're canceling it\"), and instead of having a loyal cult of followers reading it, it has no one. Since outside influences don't affect the comic book directly, it can be hard to pin the jumping the shark blame on them, usually there's a lot of suspicion.</p><p>Cancellation or termination of series. Though, technically not jumping the shark - for there aren't any bad issues after the last issue - it's considered \"bad\" for the reader that the series has ended for whatever reason. If used this way (especially if it was canceled), usually people imply that there could have been more good issues if it would have been allowed to continue.</p><p>And, if the comic was always bad, people say \"it jumped the shark from the beginning.\" Again, technically not jumping the shark, for when something jumps the shark, it goes from good to bad, but a bad title from its start to its (hopefully soon) finish, goes from bad to good, that is, its cancellation is the best thing that ever happened to it.</p>",

      "deck": "Comic book \"grades\" are given to a book reflecting the quality of printing, storage, and upkeep of a particular book.  The two main methods of describing an overall grade are numerical, and symbol.",
      "description": "<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Grading, particularly by a reputable source is often used to gauge the value of a particular book, and grading by certain companies that authenticate and certify comics books for condition and quality may add to the market value of a particular comic. Many factors are taken into account when grading. Condition of staples, inks, whiteness of cover and pages, clarity and gloss of cover, writing/tape/other damage, staining, rips, water damage/soiling, and any other conceivable type of damage or wear are taken into account when grading is done.</p><p>A major drawback to comic book grading is that there is a fairly well-used convention that is highly misunderstood and misused by casual collectors (or non-collectors). This is generally due to simple ignorance or neglect rather than malicious intent, but remaining vigilant is always advisable especially when your hard-earned cash is at stake. Some common instances of misusing comic terminology include words such as \"Good\", \"Fine\", and \"Very Good\", each of which have very specific meanings and connotations to someone who is familiar to the comic book grading scale when used to describe the overall condition of a book. Conversely, words such as \"Excellent\" and \"Great\" carry very little meaning when describing an overall book, but may successfully be used to describe very specific aspects of a book. \"Mint\" is perhaps the worst term of all, being the most misused and misunderstood of all the concepts used in comic book grading (as well as the grading of a variety of other collectables). Understanding the grading scale will help one correctly describe the condition of their books, and to understand specifically what others mean when describing the conditions of their books or the overall grade of a particular book.</p><p>This guide is by no means intended to be the be-all end-all source for comic book grading information. Rather, it is intended to be a starting point for anyone who has little to no experience in comic book grading and as a point of reference for comic fans new and old. Anyone who is serious about learning the intricacies of the art of comic book grading is highly recommended to purchase a good book on the subject (For more information see \"Overstreet\"). Otherwise, your local comic book store is also a great starting point, and can usually be a great place for advice on all things comics.</p><h2>Grading Scale</h2><p>While there is some small degree of variation on the following grading scheme within the community, the following is a representative of the general consensus on the comic book grading scale.</p><p>10.0 Gemstone/Mint GM</p><p>9.9 Mint MT</p><p>9.8 Near Mint/Mint NM/MT</p><p>9.6 Near Mint NM</p><p>9.4 Near Mint NM</p><p>9.2 Near Mint NM</p><p>9.0 Very Fine/Near Mint VF/NM</p><p>8.5 Very Fine VF</p><p>8.0 Very Fine VF</p><p>7.5 Very Fine VF</p><p>7.0 Fine/Very Fine FN/VF</p><p>6.5 Fine FN</p><p>6.0 Fine FN</p><p>5.5 Fine FN</p><p>5.0 Very Good/Fine VG/FN</p><p>4.5 Very Good VG</p><p>4.0 Very Good VG</p><p>3.5 Very Good VG</p><p>3.0 Good/Very Good GD/VG</p><p>2.5 Good GD</p><p>2.0 Good GD</p><p>1.8 Good GD</p><p>1.5 Fair/Good FR/GD</p><p>1.0 Fair FR</p><p>0.5 Poor PR</p><p>Gemstone Mint - Flawless in every way. Can be considered a \"perfect\" copy. Gem mint books occur very rarely, and are extremely rare to non-existent in older books. Gemstone Mint books are the highest grade possible. Some graders will never give a grade of a perfect 10 because they feel that there are no books which have absolutely no visible damage. In some grading schemes there is no Gem mint distinction, meaning that any book that is graded as 9.9-10.0 is Mint.</p><p>Mint - Book is virtually flawless. Cover and pages are supple and white without fading. No creases, folds, stains, etc are tolerated. Corners are sharp and edges are cut properly. Staples show no signs of wear and spine has no visible damage. In other words, a book that earns the grade \"Mint\" is virtually perfect in every way, but for some reason does not earn a perfect 10. This grade is one of the most heavily abused by those that don't understand comic book grading, and assume a book is flawless without any actual investigation.</p><p>Poor - The worst possible grade that can be given to a comic book. Damage/Wear to a Poor book is so excessive that the book holds little or no actual monetary value. A book with a Poor grade may have excessive writing, staining, fading, loose or missing pages, missing cover, excessive signs of amateur repair (such as tape damage), severely brittle pages or cover, excessive tearing, flecking, etc. Poor books with little damage (particularly important issues) may still be collectable for reading or for repair of other books.</p><h2>Grading Terms and Concepts</h2><p>When grading there are a number of things to look for, and several terms worth noting when understanding grading of comics and other periodicals.</p><p>Browning/Tanning - Covers and pages can become stained over years of miscare which can result in whites becoming tanned or browned typically by oxidation, smoke, or other soiling. Browning is worse than tanning.</p><p>Dent - Damage that occurs to a book when sharp pressure is exerted. Generally causes structural damage or damage to ink.</p><p>Dullness - Lack of light reflectivity of the cover of a book. This is detrimental to the grade of a book.</p><p>Chipping - Small pieces of a cover or page being removed, typically smaller than about a millimeter.</p><p>Clipping - Wear that occurs on the edge of a book when typically resulting in chipping or creasing.</p><p>Corner Rounding/Blunting - Rounded corners generally occur over time as the corner of a book is damaged. This can occur on any corner.</p><p>Crease/Creasing - Permanent folding, generally where color/structure is damaged resulting in a line.</p><p>Edge Wear - Damage to the sides of a comic book.</p><p>Fold/Folding - Permanent fold in pages or cover which doesn't result in color/structural damage.</p><p>Foxing - Small orange or brown discoloration on a cover or pages.</p><p>Gloss - Light reflectivity of the cover of a book. High reflectivity is prized, especially among older and higher grade books.</p><p>Heavy Crease/Heavy Creasing - Long creases, typically longer than 2 inches.</p><p>Investment Copy - Investment copy typically does not denote a specific grade of book, but is used to generalize books whose quality is good enough to expect some future gain in value.</p><p>Joined Pages - Pages that are not cut apart, resulting from a trimming error.</p><p>Light Crease/Light Creasing - Creases smaller than 2 inches.</p><p>Migration - Staining that occurs when rust damage on staples moves onto the cover and/or pages.</p><p>Mildew/Mold - Fungal damage caused by exposure to excess moisture.</p><p>Missing Pieces - May occur when pieces are ripped or torn from age and normal wear. Also includes ads or other pieces literally being cut out, can be as large as entire pages or cover missing.</p><p>Fading - Fading and other discoloration can occur when a book is exposed to outside factors such as sunlight.</p><p>Fanning/Fanned Pages - Generally caused by spine-roll when pages of comic are fanned out as to be uneven.</p><p>Filed Staples - Filing staples is a restoration technique where rust and discoloration is filed off of the staple, making the staples appear to be in better condition than they are. This can be detected under magnification.</p><p>Fleck/Flecking/Color Fleck - A fleck is a small piece of color that has been flaked off a cover, typically smaller than about a millimeter.</p><p>Pedigree - Sometimes a collection will surface (of a variety of sizes) where books are all in exceptional condition and worthy of particularly high grades that are worthy of being recognized for the collection they came from. Some grading services will recognize pedigree books in the grading. Few collections are recognized as pedigree, but are generally large, are comprised of vintage books, and were purchased by the original owner.</p><p>Pressing - Perhaps the most common type of comic book repair/restoration, pressing is the act of applying pressure (and sometimes heat) to a book to flatten it out and improve its appearance. Pressing often occurs in the home, but professional services do exist with specialized machinery to press comics.</p><p>Printing Errors - Where some other forms of printing (such as postage stamps which are controlled more carefully) may yield valuable or collectable pieces when printing errors occur, errors in printing comic books generally are not collectable. This may include off-center stapling, staples not going through all pages, folding errors, misprinted pages, covers or pages being stapled upside-down, cutting errors where cover or pages are not even, and other similar factory errors. Such errors will also yield a lower grade.</p><p>Reading Copy - Reading copy typically does not denote a specific grade of book, but is used to generalize lower quality (and lower value books). Reading Copy books are worn/damaged enough that they do not make good investments but are still good enough to read.</p><p>Repair/Restoration - Ranges from amateur to professional, books may be \"repaired\" with tape, replacement pages/staples, fixing damages in colors/tears, replacing missing chunks, etc. Sometimes Repair is used to describe improper or amateur work, while Restoration is used to describe more professional work.</p><p>Retouch/Color Touch/Color Touch-Up - Repair done to color flecks by using a replacement ink in the damaged area.</p><p>Rusted Staples - Staples (particularly in older comics) are prone to rust when exposed to too much moisture or humidity. This may also cause rust staining of the cover and pages around the staples.</p><p>Scraped Staple - Repair to rusted or discolored staples by scraping off oxidized or damaged exterior layer.</p><p>Shadow - When a portion of a book is covered by other books or other items an exposed portion may become faded or discolored from being exposed to moisture, sun, etc. that the rest of the book is not exposed to.</p><p>Smoke Damage - Tanning/Browning caused by exposure to cigarette smoke.</p><p>Smudge/Smudging - Finger oil or other soiling generally caused by rubbing with fingers.</p><p>Soiling/Staining - Staining damage to a comic by dirt, dust, or other contaminants.</p><p>Spine - Edge of a comic book created when book is stapled and folded.</p><p>Spine Roll - Caused by improper storage, comics will begin to roll up so that the staples face upward when the book is on a flat surface. In extreme cases the spine will curl over.</p><p>Spine Wear - Creasing and other damage occurring on the spine of the comic.</p><p>Stamps/Ink/Pencil Damage - Older books (particularly those sold at newsstands) may have been stamped with a date or logo that was not a part of the original publication. Also includes damage from writing by pens or pencils.</p><p>Staple Wear/Pull - Staples may cause damage in older books wear the paper or cover around the staple is creased or torn, and in extreme cases the staple is pulled through part of the book (cover and possibly pages).</p><p>Stress Lines - Damage to the spine, particularly around the staples caused by stress to the cover.</p><p>Subscription Fold/Subscription Crease - Fold or crease down the center of a book commonly caused by folding during postal delivery of a book. Because of the damage to the color a subscription crease is worse than a subscription fold.</p><p>Tape - Considered by many to be an amateur restoration, older books may have tears or loose pages repaired by scotch tape. Removal of tape can cause tape stain or residue.</p><p>Trimming - Uneven edges of a book being cut to even up uneven pages/cover or repairing damage to the edge.</p><p>Water Damage/Oil Staining - The paper used in comic books (particularly older comics) is prone to staining contact with liquids. This may be caused by exposure to water (or other liquids), oils, any of which can stain the page by altering its color and doing structural damage to the paper. Bad oil stains may cause paper to become translucent.</p><p>Whiteness - Used to gauge the opposite of Tanning/Browning. The amount of whiteness of cover and pages.</p><h2>Authentication</h2><p>Several companies exist that will offer comic grading services. Some of those also store comics in archival-quality storage cases to prevent deterioration of or damage to books.</p><p>Prominent Authentication Services</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cgccomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">CGC</a> - Grades comic books and encapsulates them in a hard archival quality capsule. Labels are enclosed with the book to identify features and remarks on the condition of the book including the Volume name, issue number, publisher, important writers and artists, page color, numerical grade, and any other remarks about the issue. Special tag colors are available for restored books, signed books (when signed under the supervision of a CGC employee), or books with serious defects.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.pgxcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">PGX</a> - Offers grading and encapsulation in a hard archival quality capsule. Label is inclosed with the Volume name, issue number, page color, numerical and grade name, and any other remarks on book quality. Remarks are made on the tag about the location of creator signatures, but PGX does not verify signature authenticity.</p><p>Books sealed and authenticated by such companies often command a greater value on the market. There are many reasons for this which include the trustworthiness of the grade, any major defects or restorations being noted, and (least importantly) the inherent value of the grading service and the protective case itself.</p><h2>Repair/Restoration</h2><p>There are mixed feelings in the comic book industry about the repair or restoration of comic books, and what it does to the value of the book. Generally only used on older books, repairs or restorations can range from rips in pages or covers taped back together, to professional quality restoration of paper, inks and colors, staples, and covers. Restorations may also include using pieces of multiple comic books of a similar era to piece back a book (such as the staples of one book) or to fix torn areas of books. Impact on the value of a book depends on many factors, but a book with significant damage that is old, rare, expensive, and highly sought after may fetch a higher value on the open market after quality, professional restoration than with damage present. Most professional authentication services will do very close and detailed inspection searching for signs of repair. While this may not effect the grade of a book significantly by such services, the remarks on the extent, quality, and area of repair are generally noted on the certification by the company.</p><p>While there is no industry consensus on Restoration of comic books, purchasing restored books is a matter of personal preference.</p><h2>Signatures</h2><p>As with repair of older comics, there is no accepted standard of what signed books will value at rather than unsigned books. Books with little significance may be relatively unaffected by the existence of a signature. Value of a book with some significance, by a person of some significance may add to the value of a book. Signatures typically do not have much (if any) effect on comic book grades as long as the signature did not cause any damage to the book. Signatures and messages generally occur on the cover of a book, but occasionally occur within the book, particularly on the first page or the inside of the cover. Some creators will take great care to sign in an area that does not obscure a particular portion of the cover (such as the artwork or title), while some generally sign in those areas, and some will sign most anywhere on the cover. Most creators will otherwise still sign where requested by the collector.</p><p>Another common practice is to have one of the contributing artist of a book do a sketch (generally accompanying the signature) on the book. These also vary with respect to size and quality. Occasionally (although rarely), publishers will even put out variant covers of comic books with blank areas designed specifically for this sort of customization. Again, this typically will not effect grading of a comic book. Value of books with sketches vary in a similar manner as signed books, and value for either will depend on the creator's contribution to the book, the creator's contribution to the comic book industry (and to a large degree their popularity), location, and quality. There is a small number within the comic book community that sees either signatures or sketches on comic books by creators as a detriment, and will factor this into grade or value. The general consensus is that neither is bad in their own right.</p><h2>The Overstreet</h2><p>The Overstreet (short for Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide and Overstreet Comic Book Grading Guide) is one of the largest and most trusted names in comic book grading and appraisal. Gemstone Publishing releases periodically updated copies of their guides. The Price Guide, currently in its 37th release, features information on the ten point comic book grading scale, as well as approximate values of thousands of American comic books with different values for the different grades of each. The Grading Guide features a much more detailed guide to learning the 10 point grading scale with full color photograph examples of every major defect available, as well as information on grading books from different <a href=\"/history-of-comics/4015-42667/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42667\">History of Comics</a>, a suggested restoration scale, and a variety of other information. The Overstreet is available in softbound, hardbound, and ring-bound formats, and past issues of the Overstreet have gained some collectors value themselves (and values of previous editions are listed in the book).</p><p>Overstreet is certainly not the only guide available for comic pricing or grading, however it is one of the most prominent and well respected publications available on the subjects. For those serious in grading and appraisal, Overstreet is a great place to start.</p><p>More information can be found on Gemstone Publishing's website at: <a href=\"http://www.gemstonepub.com\" rel=\"nofollow \">http://www.gemstonepub.com</a>.</p><p>Other appraisal sources exist, including online sources such as ComicsPriceGuide.com, a website which has detailed values of a variety of comic books from various countries including values in various conditions with CGC certification. For anyone that does not want to sink the money into a copy of the Overstreet Comic Price Guide, ComicsPriceGuide.com can be a useful resource when trying to decide whether you should bid on that online auction, or approximately how much you should expect your own books to be worth.</p><p>More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.comicspriceguide.com/default.asp\" rel=\"nofollow \">http://www.comicspriceguide.com/default.asp</a>.</p><h2>Precaution</h2><p>It is the hope of the author(s) of this page that since you have read over this material you will have a rudimentary but working knowledge of comic book grading and appraisal. Before investigating the topic further, precaution is still advisable when trying to describe books, particularly those you intend to sell. Likewise, just because you understand the basics of comic book grading does not mean that everyone else does (or intends to use them correctly). Also, while there is a fairly detailed standard of comic book grading that is commonly used, grading is difficult to do well and consistently. A NM from one grader or grading company may be only given a \"VF\" by another, a sizable difference in both approximate condition and value. When entering into a transaction remember to always supply detailed pictures so that along with your description a potential buyer can make their own judgement on specific flaws, damage, and strong features of a book. Likewise, when attempting to purchase a book (particularly in an online environment, and unless the source is trustworthy) you should obtain detailed pictures of any flaws or damage to form your own opinion before making a commitment.</p>",

Following proper storage guidelines will ensure the preservation of your comics condition, ensuring a higher <a href=\"/comic-book-grading/4015-44517/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44517\">Comic Book Grading</a> and retaining book value. This guide is intended for anyone who is <a href=\"/starting-a-comic-book-collection/46747/\" data-ref-id=\"46747\">interested in comic book collecting</a>, or has just started collecting and desires a better way to protect the books you have in stacks around your bedroom. It is also important to remember that it is never too late to start taking better care of your books. Neglect and a bad environment can causes damage, but proper care and storage can often prevent further damage from occurring.</p><h2>Bags</h2><p>Environmental contaminants such as dirt, oils, dust, and excessive moisture can not only devalue your comics by causing excess wear and damage, but may also lead to deterioration of your books. Also, unbagged comics may become scuffed easier. Bags should be made of either polyethylene, polypropylene, or mylar (polyester). All three are archival quality materials, meaning that they are formulated without acids or other harmful chemicals which will lead to the deterioration of your books. Mylar is commonly thought of as being the best choice of the three because it lasts the longest, and provides extra support, however many collectors elect to use one of the other two choices because of Mylar's higher price tag. Bags come in a variety of sizes (and thicknesses), so it is important to make sure that whatever you are buying will fit your books properly. The most common sizes are Modern, Regular, Silver, and Golden age. Most comics since the 1980's will fit in Modern size bags, so Modern bags will fit most books produced today.</p><p>Bags are designed with a long flap at the top which is to be folded over and taped down (most use simple scotch tape). This is important because you will not risk the tape making contact with your books. Self-adhesive bags are also available at a slightly higher cost. While some collectors prefer self-adhesive bags for their ease of use and convenience, others will avoid them because repeated taking out and returning of books makes it easier to get the adhesive flap stuck to your books. Bags are also available in a 3-ring binder version which will allow 3-ring binder storage of comics.</p><h2>Boards</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-132109\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-132109\"><img alt=\"Comic Boards\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Comic Boards</figcaption></figure><p>Boards provide extra structural support to your Bagged comic books. You will only want to purchase acid-free boards to store your comics to avoid contamination. Boards are inserted into comic bags behind the comic, with the back of the comic to the board. As with bags the grades of boards can vary. What is most important is purchasing archival safe boards (again, there are degrees to this too) ensuring proper care of books for the duration of their storage. Comic book boards have two sides to them: one side is rough and matte, the other side is smooth and glossy. Since boards are only intended to protect one comic, only one side is treated, this is the smooth side of the board. </p><h2>Boxes</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-132096\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/132096-35644-comic-book-care.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.72727272727273\" data-width=\"396\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 396px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/132096-35644-comic-book-care.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-132096\"><img alt=\"Short Box\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/132096-35644-comic-book-care.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/132096-35644-comic-book-care.jpg 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 396px) 100vw, 396px\" data-width=\"396\"></a><figcaption>Short Box</figcaption></figure><p>Boxes can also be an important measure to protect your books from environmental contaminants, sunlight (which can cause damage to the covers of your books), and will preserve the edges and corners of your comics. Boxes are also important because comics prefer to be stored upright rather than being laid flat or stacked, and boxes allow this to be done more easily. There are a variety of styles of Boxes, but here we will only be looking at the most common. Long Boxes and Short Boxes are the most common. A traditional Long Box will store around 300 books depending on what kind and how tightly packed they are. Short boxes only store around 100 books, but some collectors find them better suited to their needs because they are smaller (meaning easier store), and the reduced number of books makes them drastically lighter than a full long box. Another option is pull-out drawer boxes. Boxes with pull out drawers are designed exactly how they sound which can make them much more convenient for comic storage. Boxes are often stored stacked on top of one another, and enough boxes can make reaching those bottom boxes quite an ordeal each week. Boxes with pull-out drawers can be stacked and accessed at any time without having to constantly unstack or rearrange. Dividers can also be purchased for boxes (or may come with them). Dividers are not necessary for the care or protection of your boxes, but may improve access to comics.</p><p>As with Bags and Boards, boxes come in a variety of materials including cardboard, plastic, and wood or metal. Most collectors will opt to use traditional acid-free cardboard boxes because they are inexpensive, safe, and stackable. Long boxes, short boxes, and pull out drawer boxes all come in cardboard designs which can be assembled without any adhesives. Some collectors will purchase archive safe plastic boxes, and occasionally collectors with larger allowances for their comic habit will use wooden or metal cases (which can be purchased or built in a variety of styles).</p><h2>Hard Shells</h2><p>Sometimes a collector desires more than just the simple bagging and boarding. A variety of shapes and styles of comic storage devices exist on the market to give a much more rigid protective shell for comics. The main designs of such are clam-shell or slip over. Hard shells for storage can become very costly, and therefore is not something that most collectors opt to do. Some, however, will purchase special storage for their prized books: sketched or autographed copies as well as older or more valuable books. Again, you should use your discretion and make a choice here that fits your interest and budget. Also, it is still important to seek out cases that are acid and contaminant free so that your means of protecting your books do not actually destroy your books.</p><h2>Authentication Services</h2><p>Several companies exist that will offer <a href=\"/comic-book-grading/4015-44517/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44517\">Comic Book Grading</a> services. The most prominent of those will also store comics in archival-quality storage cases to prevent deterioration of or damage to books. Two of the most common are <a href=\"http://www.cgccomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">CGC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pgxcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow \">PGX</a>. The capsules used by both companies to encase comic books not only include information about the comic and its grade, but will also enclose your comic in a rigid, contaminant free exterior which rivals the best cases that one can buy on their own. One of the main drawbacks to this is the price-tag. Because of the high price tag involved this is not a good method for general storage, but can be an excellent way to offer some of the best protection to your most valuable and important books. It is worth noting that while encased for their protection, comics in these cases can still be damaged if not properly cared for. Also, these cases are designed to be tamper-evident so comics that are encased in such capsules cannot be read and the shell must be broken to remove them. This is so that the grade given and the book cannot be altered after you get your book back. These cases are also much larger than traditional comics, and require special boxes to store them.</p><h2>Repair</h2><p>If you have particularly old and valuable comics that have sustained damage or wear over the years, repair options do exist. This remains a controversial topic in the comic book community: Should I repair, or is it best to leave a book alone. Proponents of comic book repair see repairing or restoring a book as bringing it closer to its original condition, and therefore bringing it back to the way that it should be. Those who are against comic book repair often see it as deceitful, making a book appear to be something other than what it is and artificially inflating its value. While much debate exists in this area, proper restoration of a comic book can raise both its grade as well as its approximate value under the right circumstances. Some common repairs are:</p><p>Pressing - Pressing a comic is the act of putting it under large amounts of pressure (and sometimes heat) in order to flatten it out. This can raise the value of an older book; sometimes by thousands. Pressing can be as simple as leaving a book under a stack of dictionaries, and there are even professional pressing services that use special machinery to apply both heat and pressure to a book.</p><p>Staple Repair - Rusted staples may be filed down and smoothed to remove oxidation and discoloration. If this is done well it is only evident under magnification. Staples may be re-folded and re-attached to books when they come loose, and the paper of the book may be tucked under and inside the staple.</p><p>One's stance on repair or restoration is simply a personal choice, but it is good to understand both sides of the issue before one decides to go ahead and have books restored (or attempting to do it on your own).</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>One particularly easy aspect of comic book care, preservation, and handling that is easy to overlook is personal hygiene. It is important to have clean, dry hands when working with your comics. Dirt, oils, dust, and other contaminants can damage comic books. This is especially true when dealing with older comics. Acid in particular has been mentioned several times throughout this article because the papers comic books are printed on (particularly older comics) can be highly susceptible to damage from acid, and will deteriorate much more quickly in its presence. Smokers should be particularly careful because the chemicals in cigarette and cigar smoke will also destroy your books. Keep your books away from sunlight and florescent light. Sun and florescent light will damage book covers causing them to lose color vibrancy and gloss. Comic books also prefer to be stored in a cool, dry place. Heat and moisture (including humidity) can cause a variety of damage to books including mold, mildew, water staining and wrinkling of paper. Also, because of inferior papers and inks older comics are much more susceptible to just about all forms of damage than those produced to day. This is particularly true of books that are already damaged with age and wear.</p>",

Not only do they talk to the reader, but they (usually) know that they are fictional creations in a story. On occasion, this may be a vehicle for dramatic irony. <a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a>, the most well known example of this phenomenon, has been known to refer to his own history in issue format, lean on the panel borders, and see or touch his thought boxes and word balloons.</p><p>The fourth wall can also be reinforced by a character saying that, i.e., 'this isn't a movie, you know'.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h4>Characters that have broken the Fourth Wall</h4><p><strong>(Note: Characters may have broken the 4th wall at one point in time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they currently retain the knowledge of the world beyond the comic they are in)</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Alex Luthor</a></li><li><a href=\"/alex-luthor/4005-24087/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24087\">Ambush Bug</a></li><li><a href=\"/animal-man/4005-22707/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22707\">Animal Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/bat-mite/4005-23170/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23170\">AO Major</a></li><li><a href=\"/bat-mite/4005-23170/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23170\">Bat-Mite</a></li><li><a href=\"/black-hand/4005-31977/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31977\">Black Hand</a></li><li><a href=\"/bomb-queen/4005-40609/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40609\">Bomb Queen</a></li><li><a href=\"/bat-mite/4005-23170/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23170\">Canis</a></li><li><a href=\"/cerebus/4005-24391/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24391\">Cerebus</a></li><li><a href=\"/deadpool/4005-7606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7606\">Deadpool</a></li><li><a href=\"/demon/4005-7367/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7367\">Demon</a></li><li><a href=\"/fig-keele/4005-56001/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56001\">Fig Keele</a></li><li><a href=\"/forbush-man/4005-6808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6808\">Forbush Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/gabreality/4005-42151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42151\">Gabreality</a></li><li><a href=\"/gary-the-pathetic-fallacy/4005-19546/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19546\">Gary, the Pathetic Fallacy</a></li><li><a href=\"/go-go-fiasco/4005-12287/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12287\">Go-Go Fiasco</a></li><li><a href=\"/grifter/4005-23624/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23624\">Grifter</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-intern/4005-46429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46429\">The Intern</a></li><li><a href=\"/jack-horner/4005-5955/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5955\">Jack Horner</a></li><li><a href=\"/jamie-braddock/4005-4270/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4270\">Jamie Braddock</a></li><li><a href=\"/john-constantine/4005-3329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3329\">John Constantine</a></li><li><a href=\"/john-lynch/4005-4589/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4589\">John Lynch</a></li><li><a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">The Joker</a></li><li><a href=\"/jon-johnson/4005-92709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92709\">Jon Johnson</a></li><li><a href=\"/lobo/4005-6578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6578\">Lobo</a></li><li><a href=\"/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a></li><li><a href=\"/mr-mxyzptlk/4005-27436/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27436\">Mr. Mxyzptlk</a></li><li><a href=\"/mr-revise/4005-61698/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61698\">Mr. Revise</a></li><li><a href=\"/phantom-stranger/4005-3298/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3298\">Phantom Stranger</a></li><li><a href=\"/pinkie-pie/4005-86633/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86633\">Pinkie Pie</a></li><li><a href=\"/promethea/4005-22288/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-22288\">Promethea</a></li><li><a href=\"/purple-man/4005-3227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3227\">Purple Man</a></li><li><a href=\"/quantum-woody/4060-56288/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56288\">Quantum &amp; Woody</a></li><li><a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a></li><li><a href=\"/squirrel-girl/4005-2488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2488\">Squirrel Girl</a></li><li><a href=\"/starman/4005-7646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7646\">Starman</a></li><li><a href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\">Superboy Prime</a></li><li><a href=\"/suzie-dickson/4005-92710/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-92710\">Suzie Dickson</a></li><li><a href=\"/t-ray/4005-19994/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19994\">T-Ray</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-killer/4005-40808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40808\">The Killer</a></li><li><a href=\"/watcher/4005-7120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7120\">Uatu the Watcher</a></li><li><a href=\"/zatanna/4005-5691/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5691\">Zatanna</a></li></ul><h2>Creators</h2><p><i>Note: This list does not include creators who are in (auto)biographical comics as these stories are about the creators and set in the real world, not in a fictional one. Also, homages to creators or \"easter egg\" appearances do not count, the characters have to explicitly make clear they are breaking the fourth wall.</i></p><p>Some writers break the fourth wall by inserting themselves into the story, wherein their character admits to writing the story they are appearing in:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/alan-moore/4040-40382/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40382\">Alan Moore</a> as <a href=\"/alan-moore/4005-72460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72460\">Alan Moore</a>: Wrote himself into Promethea when \"the world was ending\" and our realities were converging, he is seen writing the script for the page he appears on.</li><li><a href=\"/ben-templesmith/4040-41105/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41105\">Ben Templesmith</a> as <a href=\"/ben-templesmith/4005-73450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73450\">Ben Templesmith</a>: He claims to be the biographer for Wormwood, Wormwood writes him off as some loon but Templesmith gets irate claiming he's had Eisner nominations three years in a row now, yeah, whatever.</li><li><a href=\"/brian-k-vaughan/4040-40448/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40448\">Brian K. Vaughan</a> as <a href=\"/brian-k-vaughan/4005-79942/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79942\">Brian K. Vaughan</a>: Written into Ex Machina as the writer of the comic that will follow the life of Mayor Hundred, shares some of his own personal stories and feelings about New York City and 9/11. Y: The Last Man is also referenced where he clears up that the Daughters of the Amazon are asexual not lesbians. Ironically, he criticizes the use of inserting oneself into the story, mentioning Grant Morrison and saying that it's too \"meta\" and takes him out of the story.</li><li><a href=\"/grant-morrison/4040-40434/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40434\">Grant Morrison</a> as <a href=\"/the-writer/4005-46248/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46248\">The Writer</a>: Perhaps the most well-known example, Grant Morrison inserted himself into the end of his Animal Man run (which was already full of instances where the Fourth Wall was broken) and he explains everything to Animal Man, why he killed his family, what his views are, etc. He mentions that he's also writing Doom Patrol and in the end \"restores\" everything to the status quo.</li><li><a href=\"/jh-williams-iii/4040-9316/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-9316\">J.H. Williams III</a> as <a href=\"/jh-williams-iii/4005-7682/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7682\">J.H. Williams III</a>: Written into Promethea, alongside Alan Moore (see above); is seen drawing the two-page spread he appears in.</li><li><a href=\"/jonathan-ames/4040-11217/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-11217\">Jonathan Ames</a> as <a href=\"/jonathan-a/4005-24158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24158\">Jonathan A.</a>: Protagonist of The Alcoholic. Although this is something of a unique situation, being that the comic is semi-autobiographical, the comic is not meant to be taken as a factual detailing of the writer's life and has fiction inserted, however, the character does talk directly to the reader at points. Although he is more of a character then a creator writing himself into a comic, he is placed in this list due to the fact that his name and life are based on his creator.</li><li><a href=\"/roy-thomas/4040-42067/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42067\">Roy Thomas</a> and his wife Jeanie are introduced at a Halloween Party to the other guests in <a href=\"/the-avengers-the-revolutions-fine/4000-11152/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-11152\">The Avengers #83</a>, written by Thomas. They are dressed as Spider-Man and Mrs. Fantastic. Jeanie Thomas is asking one of the Avengers which of them Mrs. Peel is.</li><li><a href=\"/peter-milligan/4040-41484/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41484\">Peter Milligan</a> as <a href=\"/miles-laimling/4005-69370/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69370\">Miles Laimling</a>: \"Laimling\" being an anagram of \"Milligan\". He is originally just some guy writing \"The Great American Novel\" in Hotel Shade and stealing the identities of Shade, Lenny and Kathy as he writes them. Eventually he breaks the Fourth Wall entirely when he says he's going to write their adventures as a comic and looks at the reader.</li><li><a href=\"/tony-harris/4040-4485/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4485\">Tony Harris</a> as <a href=\"/tony-harris/4005-79941/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-79941\">Tony Harris</a>: Appeared with Brian K. Vaughan (see above), he is portrayed as the \"cooler\" of the two and brings his art portfolio to show off to Mayor Hundred's staff. While Vaughan talks with Hundred, Harris hangs out with January and other staff and draws Bradbury in a \"badass-style\" pose.</li></ul><p>Other creators have also appeared in comics, although were inserted by someone else, rather then doing it themselves:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/karen-berger/4040-43437/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43437\">Karen Berger</a> as <a href=\"/karen-berger/4005-65580/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65580\">Karen Berger</a>: Inserted into <a href=\"/house-of-mystery-292-dance-of-death/4000-117484/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-117484\">House of Mystery #292</a> (her first book edited at DC) as the editor to replace Len Wein (see below). <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/cain/4005-9646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9646\">Cain</a> seems to warm to her quickly.</li><li><a href=\"/len-wein/4040-41457/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41457\">Len Wein</a> as <a href=\"/len-wein/4005-32778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32778\">Len Wein</a>: Apparently Cain doesn't think he's a very good editor.</li></ul><h2>Fifth Wall</h2><p>When characters break the \"Fifth Wall,\" it shows they have knowledge of other fictional characters from another, unrelated actuality.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>in <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/the-amazing-spider-man-123-just-a-man-called-cage/4000-13467/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-13467\">The Amazing Spider-Man #123</a>, after being hit through a window by Spider-Man, Luke Cage says \"I dig, Spider-Man ... but here's something you don't! Some dudes have to do this number for a livin' -- we ain't all rich playboys like Bruce Wayne.\" Note that Luke Cage should probably not know of Bruce Wayne, and vice versa.</p><p>In <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman-50/4000-33506/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-33506\">Superman #50</a>, Mr. Mxyzptlk makes several statements hinting that he is also the <a href=\"/impossible-man/4005-7590/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7590\">Impossible Man</a> from Marvel Comics and has knowledge of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, such as \"Having fun with my new fantastic friends,\" \"back to my four new friends,\" It's blubbering time,\" and \"Sometimes it's just impossible to remember what I look like from world to world.\"</p><h2>Recap Pages</h2><p>Some comics have recap pages before the actual story in which characters from that issue (or sometimes the previous one) show up and talk to the reader, breaking the Fourth Wall. These instances are generally isolated and after the recap page, the characters no longer have the ability to break the Fourth Wall. For examples of this, check out the Cable/Deadpool and Irredeemable Antman series.</p><p>Likewise in pages outside of the story, usually at the back of the comic in distinctly separate areas, characters will often address the reader for promotional purposes or for humorous effect.</p>",

Their most notable creation was the Joker's sidekick <a href=\"/harley-quinn/4005-1696/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1696\">Harley Quinn</a>. Here are a few more notable entries some of which made it into the mainstream DCU:</p><ol><li><a href=\"/renee-montoya/4005-3716/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3716\">Renee Montoya</a> (A detective introduced in B:TAS that is now in the DCU)</li><li>Nora Fries (Mr. Freeze's wife introduced in B:TAS and incorporated into the DCU)</li><li><a href=\"/livewire/4005-4678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4678\">Livewire</a> (A Superman villain introduced in S:TAS and brought into the DCU)</li><li><a href=\"/phantasm/4005-12506/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12506\">The Phantasm</a> (A villains introduced in B:MotP roughly based on the Reaper from [[Batman: Year Two:char:42225]])</li><li><a href=\"/terry-mcginnis/4005-40501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40501\">Terry McGinnis</a> (The future Batman introduced in Batman Beyond and has since appeared in Batman/Superman and Countdown.)</li><li><a href=\"/warhawk/4005-4685/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4685\">Warhawk</a> (The future son of <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a> and <a href=\"/hawkgirl/4005-6903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6903\">Hawkgirl</a> introduced in Batman Beyond)</li><li><a href=\"/gray-ghost/4005-45102/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45102\">Gray Ghost</a> (The hero of a young Bruce Wayne shown in B:TAS)</li></ol><h4>Production</h4><p><a href=\"/bruce-timm/4040-7365/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7365\">Bruce Timm</a> was given the job of turning the popular comic book adventure into an animated series. Timm took the series in a more contemporary direction to that of the previous incarnations like the Super Friends. Leaving the sidekicks and pets behind Timm had two main aims when he was making the series, to pay homage to the original line up of the <a href=\"/justice-league/4060-55928/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55928\">Justice League</a> ( <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"/aquaman/4005-2357/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2357\">Aquaman</a>, <a href=\"/green-lantern/4015-41148/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41148\">Green Lantern</a> ( <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/4005-40431/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40431\">Kyle Rayner</a>), <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a> (Wally West) and <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/4005-2047/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2047\">Martian Manhunter</a> .) and to promote cultural and racial diversity. The line up of the team was changed slightly but still both goals were achieved. The line up of the series stood as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Flash ( <a href=\"/wally-west/4005-23879/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23879\">Wally West</a>), <a href=\"/hawkgirl/4005-6903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6903\">Hawkgirl</a> (who replaced Aquaman in favor of a second female member) and the African American John Stewart as Green Lantern who replaced Kyle Rayner to promote racial diversity. Kyle Rayner (who appeared in Superman series) was not chosen for that reason and in season two Kyle was described as a trainee Green Lantern under the tutelage of John Stewards old mentor, although both Kyle would later make appearances in Justice League Unlimited.</p><p>The show was greeted with great success somewhat due to many loyal fans who were already familiar with the incarnation of the characters but the show also introduced the characters to an entire generation. Due to the fact that most episodes were one of two parts Cartoon Network chose to run two episodes back to back. It was later learned in the DVD release of season two that the episode “Starcrossed” was expected to be the final episode of the entire series but in February 2004 Cartoon Network released the next season with a new name, Justice League Unlimited. The show premiered on July 31st 2004.</p><p>The new series featured an expanded League who had opened their doors to nearly all of the Superhero community . Due to the great number of characters now in the show episodes tended to star three or four at a time so as to keep up with character development and so as not to drown out the quality of the show with quantity. In several episodes the entire roster of <a href=\"/justice-league-international/4060-26208/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26208\">League</a> members star often the entire brut force of all the members are needed to fight off universal threats.</p><h2>Character Changes</h2><p>Timm sought out to keep the continuity of the DC Animated Universe alive and so sought out Kevin Conroy to voice <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, who he played in <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> (1992) and in <em>Batman Beyond</em> (1999). Conroy set out to make his voice different then the two previous incarnations of Batman as Justice League/Justice League Unlimited is set after Batman: The Animated Series and before Batman Beyond. To do this Conroy made his sot harsher and more weathered than Batman: The Animated Series but softer then <a href=\"/batman-beyond/4050-6421/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-6421\">Batman Beyond</a>. To also add to the development of the character Batman’s costume was changed. The spikes or ears found at the top of his mask were made more prominent then in Batman: The Animated Series, his boots were also given slight heels and red highlights replaced the blue ones found in Batman : The Animated Series.</p><p>In Justice League, Superman’s overall look was redesigned so as to show him looking slightly older then in his previous animated series. To do this he was given a slight squint in his eyes and a slightly greying streak to his hair. He was also made to look broader in the series to suggest greater physical strength. Fans did not react well to the changes made and so at the beginning of season two the creators toned down the streak in his hair (to the point of almost disappearing) and took the squint away all together. As an inside joke to this failure the facial templates for the original <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> were used for <a href=\"/jor-el/4005-9561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9561\">Jor-El</a> in the episode “For the Man who has Everything”.</p><p>Most other characters were left close enough to their comic book counterparts although some notable changes were made. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>’s (voiced by Susan Eisenberg) back story changed from that of her competing against her Amazonian sisters to her being an ambassador to the outside world. This is seen in the episode “Secret Origins” She has also been referred to as a rookie hero and several episodes touch on how hard she is finding it to adjust to the new life she now leads. Also the <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a> (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum) was given attributes that made him appear slightly younger and less mature then in his comic book incarnation. It has also been noted that he was given several traits to that of Plastic Man who usually provides the comic relief for the team in the comic book series. In this incarnation of the team Flash was found to be the funny one. <a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a>’s (voiced by Phil LaMarr) back story was also changed. The original comic story was that of a civilian architect but was changed to him being a hardened ex-marine for the series.</p><p>One character that was entirely changed was Aquaman. He was dropped completely from the team in place of Hawkgirl. Maria Canals was cast to voice the part of Hawkgirl because of her Hispanic accent. The creators thought that as Hawkgirl was not from Earth so it would make her stand out as a more foreign character within the team. Her back story was set so that she had been transported to earth by criminals using a Zeta beam. Hawkgirl and Green Lantern John Stewart began a romantic relationship. Later in the series it was revealed that she was actually a scout for the <a href=\"/thanagarians/4060-31019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31019\">Thanagarian</a> invasion force. Obviously the League felt betrayed by this, especially when the entire Thanagarian force arrived ready to over throw earth. To make matters worse Hawkgirl went to their aid. Eventually the <a href=\"/thanagarians/4060-31019/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31019\">Thanagarians</a> left but Hawkgirl remained on earth. She fled from the League in shame and chose to stay with <a href=\"/doctor-fate/4005-5898/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5898\">Dr.Fate</a> and his wife Inza in their stronghold to find piece of mind and a new direction in life. She was eventually brought back to kill her possessed friend <a href=\"/solomon-grundy/4005-8342/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8342\">Solomon Grundy</a>. After this she chose to rejoin the league and was warmly excepted back into it. She decide to leave her Thangaran military dress for more conventional attire. Although her and John's relationship would never be the same again.</p><p>Another romantic relationship was that of Batman and Wonder Woman. The creators of the show did not seem to like the fans insistence of Wonder Woman being paired with Superman. Although no relationship actually blossomed it was the intent of Wonder Woman but Batman on several occasions turned her down saying that if his villains knew about them they could use her to get to him. Although Batman kissed, danced and sang to save Wonder Woman, no one knows what he really wanted!!!</p><p>Martian Manhunter also went under change. In his comic books he is found to have a power called Martian Vision usually shown as a beam of light, an extension off his telekinesis, but which also works very like Superman’s heat vision. This power was dropped in his animated form in favor of his shape shifting and phasing abilities.</p><h3><u>Heart of Ice</u></h3><p>Up until Batman the Animated Series, <a href=\"/mr-freeze/4005-3715/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3715\">Mr. Freeze</a> did not have much of a characterization or back story in the comics. Thanks to a unique design by Mike <a href=\"/mike-mignola/4040-1672/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-1672\">Mignola</a> and a tragic back story thought up by Bruce Timm, Freeze went from a crummy hoodlum, to a tragic villain who only wanted to save his wife. Fan reception to this version of the character forced the story into mainstream. The episode he appeared in was \"Heart of Ice\" which introduced the entire background story and even ended up winning an Emmy for \"Best Animation\". Mr. Freeze would go on to be in every season of B:TAS, make an appearance in the first season of Batman Beyond, and even have his own movie dedicated to him.</p><h3><ins>Initiation</ins></h3><p>When the Justice League decided to expand their numbers they became incredibly powerful, it was Bruce Timm's choice to then add <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Green Arrow</a> after popular fan demand. The fans saw Green Arrow as an almost eighth member to the original seven member team. A second reason to add Ollie was to form a bridge between the new JLU and the people on Earth. He was the first hero to appear in JLU. He appeared in \"Initiation\", the first episode of the first season. Originally he did not want to join because he felt that they had given up on the \"little man\" and he was the only thing protecting him, but after some convincing from Batman he joined and helped keep them together when Superman almost disbanded the group.</p><h3><ins>Question Authority</ins></h3><p>During the Justice League Unlimited run Bruce Timm decided to add one of his favorite characters, little did he know adding him would be a huge development. The Question first fully appeared in \"Fearful Symmetry\" where he was given a complete persona redesign. This Question was one of the league's top detectives (second to Batman and maybe <a href=\"/elongated-man/4005-4437/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4437\">Elongated Man</a>) but he was incredibly paranoid and claimed to see patterns in useless bits of information. His design was the O'Neil version from the 80s comics and over the course of the series he developed a relationship with <a href=\"/huntress/4005-1690/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1690\">Huntress</a>, much like his comic book counterpart. Timm's reaction to his <a href=\"/question/4005-3211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3211\">Question</a> made him want to do a series completely based on him and that is somewhat what he did for the second season (or first season according to the DVDs) finale in which the Question discovers a link between <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Luthor</a>, the <a href=\"/justice-lords/4060-57288/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57288\">Justice Lords</a>, <a href=\"/project-cadmus/4060-47233/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47233\">Cadmus</a>, and <a href=\"/flash/4005-2354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2354\">Flash</a> that could potentially destroy the planet. Fan reaction to Timm's version of the character was phenomenal and he, much like <a href=\"/green-arrow/4005-5936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5936\">Green Arrow</a>, became a major reoccurring character,</p><h3>Differences</h3><p>There are many notable differences between the regular DCU and the DCAU, here are a few:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> does not have an \"S\" shield on his back</li><li><a href=\"/doctor-fate/4005-5898/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5898\">Dr. Fate</a> does not have a fin on his helmet</li><li><a href=\"/jason-todd/4005-6849/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6849\">Jason Todd</a> never existed</li><li><a href=\"/tim-drake/4005-9290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9290\">Tim Drake</a>'s origin is much closer to Jason Todd's</li><li><a href=\"/question/4005-3211/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3211\">The Question</a> is a conspiracist and much more paranoid.</li><li><a href=\"/amazo/4005-3737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3737\">Amazo</a>'s appearance and characterization is severely different, and is completely golden instead of his original costume.</li><li><a href=\"/hal-jordan/4005-11202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11202\">Hal Jordan</a> does not seem to exist in the universe but he did appear in \"The Once And Future Thing\" Pt. 2 because of a time-space flux.</li><li><a href=\"/doomsday/4005-9989/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9989\">Doomsday</a> never killed <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a>.</li><li><a href=\"/static/4005-26578/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26578\">Static</a> is in the same universe as <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> and Superman opposed to a separate one.</li><li><a href=\"/john-stewart/4005-10451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10451\">John Stewart</a> and <a href=\"/hawkgirl/4005-6903/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6903\">Hawkgirl</a> have a relationship here that was never present in the comics.</li><li><a href=\"/oracle/4005-5368/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5368\">Barbara Gordon</a> was never paralyzed by the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a>.</li><li><a href=\"/orion/4005-2363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2363\">Orion'</a>s Astro-Harness is silver instead of gold.</li></ul>",

For example Bucky becoming Winter Soldier then later becoming <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> and Dick Grayson becoming Batman.</p><p>Sidekicks are also a way for young readers to relate to stories and feel as if they are working with or for the main hero. By tying young readers into relate-able sidekicks they are then tied into the main hero which allows more readership. As a marketable tool sidekicks have done very well for comics mainly in the forties and fifties. Since then their deaths and resurrections have been very marketable.</p><p> </p><p>Below is an alphabetical list of superheroes and their sidekick counterparts.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Superhero</th><th>Sidekick</th><th>Publishers</th></tr><tr><td>Aquaman</td><td>Aqualad, Aquagirl I, Aquagirl II, Aquagirl III, Aquagirl IV, Aqualad II, Aqualass, Topo</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Batman</td><td>Robin I, Robin II, Robin III, Robin IV, Robin V, Batgirl I, Batgirl II, Batgirl III, Batgirl IV</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Black Terror</td><td>Kid Terror</td><td>Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Blue Beetle (Dan Garret)</td><td>Sparky</td><td>Fox Comics, Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Blue Devil</td><td>Kid Devil</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Booster Gold</td><td>Skeets, Goldstar</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Captain America</td><td>Bucky</td><td>Marvel Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Captain Battle</td><td>Captain Battle Jr.</td><td>Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Captain Marvel</td><td>Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr.</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Catman</td><td>Kitten</td><td>Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Catwoman</td><td>Catgirl</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Congo Bill</td><td>Janu</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Doctor Mid-Nite</td><td>Hooty</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamic Man</td><td>Dynamic Woman, Dynamic Boy</td><td>Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Flame</td><td>Flame Girl</td><td>Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Flash</td><td>Kid Flash I, Kid Flash II</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Green Arrow</td><td>Speedy I, Speedy II</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Green Hornet</td><td>Kato</td><td>Holyoke Comics, Harvey Comic, Dell Comics, Now Comics, Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Green Lantern</td><td>Doiby Dickles</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Hawkman</td><td>Big Red</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Human Torch</td><td>Toro</td><td>Marvel Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Lone Ranger</td><td>Tonto</td><td>Dell Comics, Dynamite Entertainment</td></tr><tr><td>Sandman</td><td>Wing</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Slam Bradley</td><td>Shorty Morgan</td><td>DC Comics</td></tr><tr><td>Spectre</td><td>J.

She also came with modern era clothes rather than the military uniform so as to reflect the change in venue on TV. Interestingly enough, this one looked less like Lynda Carter and she didn’t appear on the box. Most likely this was because the show had begun to slip in ratings. There was a third version of the 12” doll but the main difference was in the box itself, which still used the same comic drawing but added a description of Paradise Island and, of course, the not so subtle hint that you could surround Wondy with friends and foes.

      "description": "<p>Primordial chaos and darkness opposite of order and light, <a href=\"/the-angelus/4005-43945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43945\">Angelus</a>. Darkness is considered one of the <a href=\"/the-13-artifacts/4015-55685/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55685\">13 Artifacts</a>. Darkness and Angelus also have an offspring, that acts as balance between the two forces, it is named <a href=\"/witchblade/4005-18319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-18319\">Witchblade</a>.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The wielder of the Darkness possesses a number of supernatural abilities. The Darkness power allows the wielder to create anything they desire. One of the primary weapons of the Darkness is the ability to generate solid constructs such as blades, claws, and protective armor. The darkness can also be used to create living, sentient beings that are controlled by the wielder. These darkness creatures are often in the form of imps or demons often referred to as <a href=\"/darklings/4060-47569/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47569\">Darklings</a>. They tend to be violent in nature, and use a lot of profanity when they talk. The possessor of the darkness can also hear and see remotely through these creatures. Close proximity is also not necessary as they can be created and left in a dark area and controlled remotely via a telepathic control over the creatures.</p><p>Creations of the Darkness are not limited to Darklings, however. Possessors of the Darkness in the past have even created human-like creatures out of the Darkness for many purposes including sex (see Weaknesses and Limitations: Celibacy).</p><h2>Weaknesses and Limitations</h2><h3><b>Light</b></h3><p>As suggested by the name, a primary weakness of the Darkness is that it only functions in the absence of light. The Darkness cannot be accessed in the light and when light hits anything created of the Darkness it vanishes. This leaves the wielder particularly vulnerable during the day, however even during the day if protection from the light can be found the Darkness can be used. The darkness can be accessed simply by being in a non-lit room or even under the cover of smoke as long as it is thick enough to provide protection from the light.</p><h3><b>Celibacy</b></h3><p>All wielders of the Darkness pass on the Darkness to their heirs through sex. Upon the conception of their child they die, so males in the Estacado family generally die during intercourse. This can be quite a burden for some, and the Darkness has been used in the past to create sentient humanoids for the purpose of sexual gratification.</p><h2>Hosts</h2><p>This is a list of all those who have wielded the Darkness Power</p><ul><li><a href=\"/the-foreigner/4005-62333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62333\">The Foreigner</a> (8000 BC)</li><li>Unnamed Past Wielder</li><li>Black Captain (9th century)</li><li><a href=\"/lord-cardinale/4005-52136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52136\">Lord Cardinale</a> (1175)</li><li><a href=\"/christian-estacado/4005-50101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50101\">Christian Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/idris/4005-62711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62711\">Idris</a> (14th century)</li><li><a href=\"/michaelangelo-estacado/4005-52559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52559\">Michaelangelo Estacado</a> (16th century)</li><li><a href=\"/antonio-estacado/4005-52553/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52553\">Antonio Estacado</a> (~1500)</li><li><a href=\"/miguel-estacado/4005-45821/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45821\">Miguel Estacado</a> (1671)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/ramon-estacado/4005-88565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-88565\">Ramon Estacado</a> (1878)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/teo-estacado/4005-108559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-108559\">Teo Estacado</a> (1897)</li><li><a href=\"/belasco-estacado/4005-52556/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52556\">Belasco Estacado</a> (1908)</li><li><a href=\"/adelmo-estacado/4005-103213/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-103213\">Adelmo Estacado</a> (1912)</li><li><a href=\"/anthony-estacado/4005-47570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47570\">Anthony Estacado</a> (1918 Alternate Universe)</li><li><a href=\"/roberto-estacado/4005-52550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52550\">Roberto Estacado</a> (1942)</li><li><a href=\"/danny-estacado/4005-45820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45820\">Danny Estacado</a> (late 20th century)</li><li><a href=\"/capris-castiglione/4005-52521/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52521\">Capris Castiglione</a> - Twin-sister of Jackie Estacado, first female host.</li><li><a href=\"/the-darkness/4005-24347/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24347\">Jackie Estacado</a> - Current possessor of The Darkness, known also as The Darkness.</li><li>Bud Starling - Possible near future wielder.</li><li>Unnamed Future Wielder</li><li><a href=\"/tony-estacado/4005-123551/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-123551\">Tony Estacado</a> - Wielder from the Switch timeline</li></ul><h2>The Loophole</h2><p>It has been stated that Jackie Estacado would die and pass on the Darkness to his offspring if he were to create a child through sexual intercourse.

Its not that everyone is mysterious and there are no important characters, its just that the name itself is not really needed to further the story. For example, the <a href=\"/saint-of-killers/4005-10522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10522\">Saint of Killers</a> is never named once, not because his origin is secret, in fact his origin is told in a four-issue miniseries, its because his name isn't important, and as such neither are his wife and daughter named, because they don't need to be, the only thing that makes them important is their relationship to Saint, knowing their names won't change the story.</p><p>Most of the time though, to replace the absence of a name, such as with The Saint of Killers family, their relationship to characters that are named will be mentioned, while other times there just characters that no one can ever refer to without a picture or something of the sort.</p>",

Good Girl Art in comics is understood to depict characters of the sweet or heroic variety, as opposed to Bad Girl Art, which features edgier and more violent female characters.",
      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The term \"good girl art\" was first coined in the 1930's and at the time simply referred to published illustrations of attractively-drawn female characters, be they heroines, villainesses, or anything in between. Comparable terms include \"pinup art\" and \"cheesecake art.\" In more specific comic book terms, Good Girl Art now refers to art featuring attractively-drawn female characters who are sweet or heroic in nature, i.e. \"good girls.\" This narrower definition of Good Girl Art gained relevance after the term <a href=\"/bad-girl-art/4015-43535/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-43535\">Bad Girl Art</a> (referring to attractively-drawn female characters who are dark and violent in nature) was coined in the 1990's, resulting in the need for greater distinction between the two genres.</p><p>The good girl art concept first began at the onset of World War II, during the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\">Golden Age of Comics</a>. Servicemen sought out diversions from their duties on the battlefield and at sea by reading comic strips and books featuring women drawn in the \"good girl\" style. These women were portrayed in an attractive and visually appealing manner, and were often scantily-clad in bathing suits and bikinis, or in mildly suggestive attire such as tight dresses. One of the earliest masters of the art form was artist <a href=\"/matt-baker/4040-27899/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-27899\">Matt Baker</a>, who became famous for his sexy renditions of <a href=\"/phantom-lady/4005-32175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32175\">Phantom Lady</a> and other female superheroes of the era.</p><p> </p><figure style=\"width: 517px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4678420\" data-ratio=\"0.86847195357834\" data-width=\"517\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4678420\"><img alt=\"From Darling Love #11 by Harry Lucey \" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg 517w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11114/111149159/4678420-17.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>From Darling Love #11 by Harry Lucey </figcaption></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><figure style=\"width: 975px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4678423\" data-ratio=\"1.4523076923077\" data-width=\"975\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4678423\"><img alt=\"Phantom Lady #17 by Matt Baker\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg 975w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg 661w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11114/111149159/4678423-0%20%281%29.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\"></a><figcaption>Phantom Lady #17 by Matt Baker</figcaption></figure><p> </p>",

While the Death Star charged its main planet destroying beam. Still planning their attack, the rebels had sent a small attack unit of X-Wings and to shoot down a communications satellite set up by the Empire so that they could relay information more easily. The small attack was a success and threw into confusion the Empire's defense and their ability to call reinforcements. Although two of the X-wings were shot down, the pilots of which were rescued later.</p><p>After several more preliminary strikes made by the rebels to several key points on the Death Star, including small hangars on the surface to limit it's ability to launch fighters, the rebels sent into action their main offensive attack. The assaulting fleet consisted of almost two dozen X-wings, eight Y-Wings, and a pair of R22 Spearhead starfighters.</p><p>At first, the Death Star tried to defend itself with it's laser batteries, but some had been shot by the preliminary rebel strikes, and those that were left were mainly used to fight off capital ships, much larger than the smaller more nimble fighters being used by the Rebel Alliance. The rebels were able to take down several of the turrets and a rookie pilot known as Rookie One was able to destroy a giant mounted ion cannon to set up the main phase of the assault.</p><p>Refusing to concede that the rebels were actually doing any damage the the Death Star, it's commander Grand Moff Tarkin did not send any of the station's vast resource of TIE fighters. So Darth Vader, under the realization that there might be even a minor threat, scrambled his personal fighter squadron. Soon after Vader's fighters launched and they attacked the Rebel forces, and the order to stop all laser fire from the Death Star had been given. Mostly because the lasers themselves were doing very little in shooting down any Rebels, and if they did manage to hit something it was just as likely they would hit one of the TIE fighters doing more damage.</p><p>The rebels main offensive bombing run had been planned for three attempts at a trench run, the first and second runs were executed by Gold Squadron, consisting of three Y-wings, and a squadron of three X-wings called Red Squadron, both of were unsuccessful and missed the small exhaust target. The third was lead by Luke Skywalker and two other X-wings, one of which was damaged and had to pull out while the other was destroyed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4995688-0281812332-battl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4995688\" data-ratio=\"0.74444444444444\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4995688-0281812332-battl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4995688\"><img alt=\"X-Wings and TIE fighters battling it out around the Death Star.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4995688-0281812332-battl.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11117/111173561/4995688-0281812332-battl.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11117/111173561/4995688-0281812332-battl.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-width=\"900\"></a><figcaption>X-Wings and TIE fighters battling it out around the Death Star.</figcaption></figure><p>It was at this time that the Death Star had fully charged it's weapon and was in position to fire. All seemed hopeless for Rebel Command and the last fighter who could take one last shot, Luke, disabled his targeting computer in his X-wing. However Skywalker was told by the spirit of old \"Ben\" Kenobi to \"use the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">Force</a>\" to make the near impossible shot. Sensing how strong the Force was with Luke, Vader prepared to kill him, saving the Empire, and it was only the last minute heroic deed of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon that sent Darth Vader spinning out of control in space and saved Luke.</p><p>With the aid of the Force, that was newly discovered to him, Luke Skywalker guided his last minute shot perfectly down the planned target. Seconds before the Death Star fired it's main weapon the chain reaction from Luke's torpedos had started and the station was blown up, and all on board including Grand Moff Tarkin, thousands of Imperial officers, and over one million support troops and stormtroopers were killed.</p><h2>Repercussions</h2><p>As a direct result of the Rebel Alliance victory, they were now a legitimate threat against the Empire, and because of dissolution in the Imperial Senate, systems joined the Alliance in the months afterwards by the thousands. This caused the Empire to start occupying territories it had left untouched. The actions of both sides resulted in the escalation of the war.</p><p>Lastly, twenty five years later it was decreed by the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/new-republic/4060-51084/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51084\">New Republic</a> Historical Council to institute a new calendar.

The series was ultimatly left open ended, during the \"Rings of Fate\" story line, and was met with mixed reactions.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">*Amerime: distinctive faux manga style characterized by lazy face designs based on decades-old Japanese anime &amp; heavy hybrid American comic book style influences that clash. The end result is that the art looks neither American nor Japanese &amp; the style is generally looked down upon by both comic book &amp; manga readers. A popular example of the style's usage would be the cartoon Avatar: The Last Air Bender.</p><h2>History</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the beginning, a living energy force called the Lightgiver seeded this universe with sentient life, with twelve worlds becoming the first of many to evolve such life.

In reality, what Banner had found was an Ethereal Realm populated by banished gods and monsters. The Keepers planned to use the gun to secretly bring the Elder Gods back to rule Earth, but shoddy construction caused the gun to backlash and create a twenty-four-hour worldwide blackout.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>To perform techniques a ninja must first utilize a form of energy source named, \"Chakra\" Chakra originates from two places: the first is physical energy which is inherent in the billions of cells, the second source of chakra is the mental &amp; spiritual energy gained through exercise and experience. The body itself possess many points of concentration these are often referred to as chakra points. In order to perform a jutsu, the ninja will bring out and release these two energies. The amount of chakra needed for a technique will vary greatly, depending upon its size and complexity. It will also vary from user to user depending on their chakra capacity. Ninjas are able to manipulate chakra to use <a data-ref-id=\"4015-50943\" href=\"/jutsu/4015-50943/\">jutsus</a>, molding and shaping the chakra to create the effect they want.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/912456-59799_chart_super.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912456\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.09375\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/46321/912456-59799_chart_super.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912456\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/46321/912456-59799_chart_super.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/46321/912456-59799_chart_super.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>However, each ninja also has the potential to utilize an elemental Ninjutsu style. This is due to the fact that every ninja possess one elemental affiliation. For example, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44238\" href=\"/naruto-uzumaki/4005-44238/\">Naruto</a> possess a wind affiliation and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44243\" href=\"/kakashi-hatake/4005-44243/\">Kakashi</a> possess a lightning affiliation. With an elemental affiliation comes an advantage as well as a disadvantage. For example the advantage of having a lightning elemental affiliation is that a ninja with that affiliation can master lightning based techniques more easily as well being able to perform higher level lightning based attacks. Possessing a lightning affiliation grants the ninja a higher advantage over someone possessing an earth affiliation, however the disadvantage of having a lightning affiliation is having a disadvantage over a ninja with a wind affiliation. In other words while acquiring an advantage over one opponent with a weakness to your affiliation, your affiliation has a weakness of its own. For this reason many ninja train themselves to recompose their chakra into different elemental based techniques to acquire a higher level of defense should they encounter their polar opposite as well as more options in combat. But because the ninja does not possess that particular elemental affiliation learning new moves requires more effort and limits their ability to be able to handle higher level techniques with that element.</p><h2>Main Elemental Chakras</h2><h3><strong>Katon</strong></h3><p>The Fire element technique. Katon takes on fire and flame based attacks. Its specialized as an offensive type of chakra and oftens create flame based attacks which are hurled from a distance, that gives the user distance between themselves and their opponent.</p><h3>Fuuton</h3><p>The Wind element technique takes wind based properties from a simple gust of wind to a typhoon. Out of all the elemental chakras Fuuton is most respected for it's ability to slice or act as an amplifier such as turning a simple kunai into an unstoppable bullet.</p><h3>Raiton</h3><p>The Lighting element technique takes on and off lighting based attacks.It also specializes in offensive type of chakra like fire and its ability lies in creating mid range and long attacks. It can also be used by a metal weapon like conductor. A technique that was famously used by Kakashi's father Sakumo Hatake.</p><h3>Doton</h3><p>The Eath element technique is based around earth style and it specializes in defense. By taking advantage pf the properties that make up earth. It can be used as a near perfect escape route such as using a mud slide technique to incapacitate the enemy.</p><h3><strong>Suiton</strong></h3><p>The Water element technique varies greatly depending on the users surrounding and the user itself, because of it's malleability it can be used to create powerful defenses as well as offenses. It can be from short to long range. However it's major weakness is it's user must be near any kind of water, but this however can be overcome as proven by the Nidame Hokage and Hoshigaki Kisame.</p>",

Most notably during the Silver age of comics era a lot of these ‘Imaginary Stories’ were published using DC’s main characters of <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a>, though they did also branch out into DC’s other ‘mainstream’ characters.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1031551-sept_1986.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1031551\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43547/1031551-sept_1986.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1031551\"><img alt=\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, the last 'Imaginary Story'\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43547/1031551-sept_1986.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43547/1031551-sept_1986.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></a><figcaption>Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, the last 'Imaginary Story'</figcaption></figure><p>In 1986, the last ever ‘Imaginary Story’ was published in <em><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/superman-423-whatever-happened-to-the-man-of-tomor/4000-27153/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-27153\">Superman #423</a></em> and <em><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/action-comics-583-whatever-happened-to-the-man-of-/4000-119563/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-119563\">Action Comics #583</a></em>, called “<em><a href=\"/whatever-happened-to-the-man-of-tomorrow/4045-56808/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56808\">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</a></em>” This two part story arc was promoted as Superman's final appearance at DC Comics. In this story, the Superman timeline is irrevocably altered in several ways and became a darker, more sinister place. The main story was told using flashbacks of <a href=\"/lois-lane/4005-1808/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1808\">Lois Lane</a>, who became Lois Lane-Elliot, who was being interviewed about Superman’s last appearance. \"<em>Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow</em>\" was a farewell story to honor the previous version of Superman.

Though this story does not carry the Elseworlds logo, it was retroactively changed to be the first official Elseworlds title by DC and reprints of the book carry the logo. This story was a fresh take on Batman who lived in the Victorian Age instead of modern day. The main Villain in the piece is Jack the Ripper who has come to Gotham. The first book to officially bear the Elseworlds logo and mantra was <em><a href=\"/batman-holy-terror/4050-28207/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-28207\">Batman: Holy Terror</a></em>, written by TV writer and novelist <a href=\"/alan-brennert/4040-42256/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42256\">Alan Brennert</a> and illustrated by Detective Comics stalwart <a href=\"/norm-breyfogle/4040-4768/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4768\">Norm Breyfogle</a>. In it, Batman is a priest in a theocratic dictatorship who discovers that his parents were murdered by the Church. Searching for answers and vengeance, he discovers the dark secrets at the heart of his own government, and ultimately becomes a terrorist to dismantle the system which murdered “heretics” such as his parents.</p><p>To date DC has published several Elseworlds of particular note that are considered to be ‘The Best of their League”, two specifically of note are Kingdom Come and The Dark Knight Returns. Both of these stories have received world wide acclaim for their storyline and artwork.</p><h3>The Dark Knight Returns</h3><p>\"<em><a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batman-the-dark-knight/4050-3593/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-3593\">Batman: The Dark Knight</a></em>\" was originally published in 1986 as a four part miniseries by <a href=\"/frank-miller/4040-7082/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7082\">Frank Miller</a>, it has since been widely thought of as his best work. The series was originally intended by Miller to create an end for the Batman, one where the storyline would have a complete close, this turned out not to be the case when DC published a sequel to the book “<em><a href=\"/the-dark-knight-strikes-again/4050-9221/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-9221\">The Dark Knight Strikes Again</a></em>”, a sequel to The Dark Knight Returns which brought back the original team to work on the book.</p><p>The Dark Knight Returns is set in a dark future where Batman had given up the Superhero life and gone into seclusion. While the Superheroes had left humanity to its own devices crime, both by humans and meta humans, had run rampant, and the world was quickly tearing itself apart.</p><p>The story opens on Harvey Dent being rehabilitated after plastic surgery, funded by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/wayne-enterprises/4020-56461/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56461\">Wayne Enterprises</a>. The rehabilitation does not take however and he returns to crime, forcing Batman to don the Batman costume again, something he has not done since the death of Jason Todd twenty years earlier. The story also brings in Carrie Kelly who joins Batman as <a href=\"/robin/4005-1687/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1687\">Robin</a> for the story arc, notably not the first time Robin has been female in an Elseworlds title. Also worth noting is the fact that it is Harvey Dent as <a href=\"/two-face/4005-5555/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5555\">Two-Face</a> that bring the Batman out of retirement, not the <a href=\"/joker/4005-1702/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1702\">Joker</a> as most people assume it would be.</p><p>Other changes to the Batman story become apparent as the story moves on, such as the new tank like <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/batmobile/4055-41463/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41463\">Batmobile</a> which is mirrored in the Cartoon version of The Batman and has made several other appearances in media as homage to the title.</p><h2>Kingdom Come</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-37772\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.55\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-37772\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Possibly the most noteworthy Elseworlds title to date and has been widely received as the definitive book published by DC. Published in 1996 is was written by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/mark-waid/4040-40724/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40724\">Mark Waid</a> and painted by <a href=\"/alex-ross/4040-10945/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-10945\">Alex Ross</a>, notably the artwork in the book is unusually realistic for a comic book and uses Ross’s famous style to depict the realism and darkness of the storyline. Set 20 years in the future, the superheroes have left the world to its own devices, feeling betrayed and unsure of their place in the new world. The main story centers on Superman and his reasons for leaving, and returning. Other characters of note are Batman, who was crippled by Bane and Two-Face after they found out his secret identity, he now uses giant Bat Robots to keep Gotham City under control. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a>, who has been stripped of her title by <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\">Themyscria</a> after the ruling body of The Amazon’s decreed that she had not made the world a better place. <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-2350/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2350\">Captain Marvel</a> who had retreated inside the form of Billy Batson, his alter ego, and was kept in a hypnotic state by <a href=\"/lex-luthor/4005-41952/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41952\">Lex Luthor</a> to keep him under control.</p><p>Both these stories are widely recognized as the best Elseworlds to date, though Kingdom Come draws heavily on The Dark Knight Returns for some of its imagery, both of these have sequels, though not as popular as the original books, both the sequels received the same acclaim, ‘The Dark Knight Strikes Again’ and ‘The Kingdom’ respectively follow “The Dark Knight Returns” and “Kingdom Come”.</p><p>One thing of note is in “The Kingdom” is the first mention of Hypertime, which DC used to explain the Elseworlds stories as parallel dimensions where beings could cross timelines and see what their world could have been like.</p><p>Hypertime has recently been brought back into the mainstream DCU continuity after the “52” storyline, though if this means that new Elseworlds storylines will be published or Elseworlds characters will be making appearances in the mainstream DCU in unclear at this point, all that is known is the possibility is there for anything.</p><h2>Elseworlds</h2><p>Here is a list of Elseworlds, in character order with their published dates and ISBN details for reference.</p><h3>Batman

event was branded as \"<em>Legends of the Dead Earth</em>\". These are not officially labeled as Elseworld tales but many consider them to be Elseworlds because they take place in the distant future and feature stories influenced by the legends/stories/legacies of the heroes and villains of the past for that particular title. A few of these annuals are actually in continuity because the characters are from the distant future. Twenty-five annuals had the Legends of the Dead Earth branding.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\"

      "deck": "An introduction on how to start a comic book collection and how to make that collection grow.",
      "description": "<p> </p><h2>1. Start with what you like</h2><p>Rather than divulging yourself into a comic book universe (or maybe many), focus on one character or a team (<a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/4060-31815/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-31815\">JLA</a>) only. Even independent developers have large universes. Pick one of the most popular characters or teams from one publisher that relate to you the most and stick with them. This way, you can track that certain character or team without losing yourself within the comic's universe. Also, take genres into consideration. Looking for a bit of sci-fi? Check out <a href=\"/dark-horse-comics/4010-364/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-364\">Dark Horse</a> and have a look at their take on <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">Star Wars</a>. For example, if you choose <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> as your prime candidate and during that time, the more recent issues of Wonder Woman would be a good place to start. Once you are familiar with such a character, you may lose interest in them. Remember, this is only so you can get yourself started in comics, but they may also become your favourite character. Once you being with that certain character(s), there may be cross-overs. Using Wonder Woman as an example again, you might want to start with the runs by writers such as <a href=\"/greg-rucka/4040-41228/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41228\">Greg Rucka</a> and <a href=\"/gail-simone/4040-41294/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41294\">Gail Simone</a>. If you want something a little further back, try the Wonder Woman Chronicles trades, or her <a href=\"/showcase-presents-wonder-woman/4050-30501/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-30501\">Showcase Presents</a> volumes.</p><p>One daunting issue concerning new collectors is the high issue numbers of long-time ongoing series'. When you want to read a book about a particular character you may feel like you are coming in too late when current issues are being published with issue numbers in the 400's, 500's, or more. Do not be afraid of high issue numbers. Comic writers will periodically give users \"jumping-off\" points at certain issue numbers (often at the 50's or 100's) to start a series. Larger series' are also divided into different \"story-arcs\" which serve as logical partitions of the larger series, typically lasting between 2 and 6 issues. These smaller subplots interconnect to form the larger idea. Regardless of where you start out in a book, these divisions can give you the feel for a new book. If you are concerned about catching up on the back-story you have missed (after all, some of these series' have been going on for decades) you can look for used books to fill in the gaps later, and read encyclopedia articles from ComicVine to give you an idea of what you have missed in a character or team's history.</p><p>Another way to catch up without picking up individual issues is to collect Trade Paper Backs (sometimes referred to simply as \"trades\" or TPBs). Trade Paperbacks are reprinted collections of issues (generally by story-arch or series, but sometimes by general theme), and can be purchased new or used at a variety of stores. If you are more interested in reading books, and less interested in the physical (paper) copies digital comics are rapidly becoming an interesting alternative. Some major companies such as Marvel are now putting digital copies of their books online. Some of these books can be viewed for free, and others can be purchased or subscribed to digitally.</p><h2>2. Comic book stores</h2><p>What you need from a good comic book store is a good selection of your chosen character and staff that know what they're talking about. With most comic book stores, a pull list is available, which allows you to select your favourite comics each week and the staff will collect the issues when they come in, and comics arrive on Wednesday. Many will also give you a discount to have your pull list or \"folder\" with them. A comic book store is also preferred if it is clean. Such things like dust will deteriorate the comic book's preservation. Lighting is also a bonus but probably not always needed. However, lighting allows you to see the comics properly and to see what state they are in. This does not hold for sunlight, which can damage comic books. Also, try not to spend too much too quickly. Modern comic books are often released in limited quantities with special variant covers, and because of their associated rarity these books may sell for many times what normal books cost. Antique comics of your favorite characters are also often available at comic book stores. While these types of books may be tempting, remember to go slow. New collectors may wind up with a collection of books that they overpaid or are otherwise unhappy with because they spent too much too fast.</p><p>If comic stores aren't in your present area, using a mail catalogue order is useful, as you order the comics you would like on the Internet and they get sent to your door. Payment is usually through credit card. Buying from a company's site also allows you to receive discounts from the original price if you subscribe to their services. Other sites like eBay and Amazon also provide comics to buy at discounted prices and mostly good condition. Also, comics are not restricted to comic book stores, even though they are the preferred place to buy. Major book stores like Barnes and Nobles also sell comic books.</p><p>Another place where you can get the opportunity to read more books without having to spend money is your local library. Many libraries are starting to obtain Trade Paper Backs for you to check out and enjoy without ever spending a dime.</p><h2>3. Comic Book Care</h2><p>Caring for you comic books is important if you ever want to pass them down to the next generation or want to re-read them. The easiest way is to buy bags and boards for you comic books from the comic book store, and place them in short or long boxes, which are also available at comic book stores. This will seem like a money waster, but it will pay out in the end and allow your comics to look much nicer. Check out <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/comic-book-care/4015-44586/forums/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44586\">Comic Book Care</a> for more information on other options on how to take care of your comics.</p><h2>4. Comic book databases</h2><p>Take note of each comic book that you buy. You could use a notebook or a spreadsheet application on your computer. Keep track of your collection while it's still young, so if you ever miss an issue of a certain comic book, you can go back and attempt to find it on eBay or something. Also, you can check out the back issue section in your store and see if they have anything there.</p><h2>5. Be cheap for once</h2><p>As with any hobby, collecting comic books can be expensive. Sometimes, your local comic book store might have a sale on for some really old comics. Get it while you can, because this can be great to growing your collection. However, don't buy everything that's on sale. Just focus on your focused character. This will allow you to add more depth to learning about the history of your chosen character. This also allows you for something extra to read when you've read everything on your pull list.</p><p>Also be on the lookout for cheap comics elsewhere. Some places where great deals on comics in a variety of ages and conditions are yard sales, swap meets, and flea markets/malls. Be careful not to spend too much at these places because they are also great places to get ripped off. If you are still new to comics and do not understand the subtleties of <a href=\"/comic-book-grading/4015-44517/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-44517\"> comic book grading</a>, or do not have an idea of what comics from different ages are worth you may get suckered into a \"great deal\" that turns out to be not so great. Such salesman may not be bad people. They may have little more idea than you of what their books are worth. If you are collecting for your own personal enjoyment you can hardly go wrong spending a dollar or less on comics. Sometimes you can find them as cheap as a quarter a piece. As mentioned earlier second hand auction sites on the internet can be used to help build a collection for chap, however be careful. There are many dangers (primarily being ripped off) associated with internet auctions, so use these sites at your own risk.</p><h2>6. Attend a comic book convention</h2><p>Attend a comic convention, such as <a href=\"/san-diego-comic-con/4020-55786/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55786\"> ComicCon</a>. Doing so will allow you to interact with other comic book lovers and maybe allow you to make a friend or two sharing the same favourite of a character as you. You also will often have the opportunity to meet the writers and artists behind your favorite books in person, often getting a signature or sketch while you are there. Attending ComicCons also allow you to buy plenty of issues missed on your chosen character and browsing through all the booths are enjoyable. Also, you may also get some news on new and up coming comic storylines and new movies that are being made. ComicCons may not always visit your city, but that doesn't mean it will stop you from attending smaller ones.</p><h2>7. One more thing - enjoy it!</h2><p>Don't take this hobby too seriously, unless that's what you want. Comic books should be enjoyed by everyone and each character should be respected. Voicing your opinion may induce some interesting discussions, but in reality, they are created to be read. For example, some comic readers use it as a means of escape. Also, don't be embarrassed if you don't know much about your favourite character. Comic books are meant to be a world of discovery. Starting from where you are and enjoying yourself with his hobby is all you need. If someone knows about Spider-Man's webbing chemicals more than you, then let them. Bottom line is, enjoy the comics as they are and if you wish to continue into something even further (like knowing everything about Spider-Man's webbing chemicals) then you are welcome to do that too.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Quickening</h2><p>A Quickening in an Immortals life force, it holds all their strength, knowledge and power. The Quickening can only be released from the body after decapitation, once this happens the Quickening is absorbed into the victor, or the nearest Immortal if the decapitation happened by accident or by mortal means.</p><p>Quickening’s are massively destructive, though the extent of the devastation is dependent on how old and how powerful the immortal is. During the episode “Comes a Horseman”, Duncan MacLeod and Methos received a shared Quickening that almost completely destroyed a factory from two characters that were over 3000 years old, but during Endgame, Duncan MacLeod received a Quickening so powerful it cleared the atmosphere of clouds and destroyed a major power plant in New York, this Quickening was from Jacob Kell who was just over 600 years old.</p><h3>Dark Quickening</h3><p>If an Immortal received too many Quickening’s from ‘evil’ Immortals, then the build up can eventually overcome the immortals psyche and turn them into a dark, twisted version of themselves. This happened to Duncan MacLeod in season 4 of the television when an Immortal Native American named Coltec was eventually overwhelmed by the Dark Quickening. Duncan MacLeod eventually killed Coltec and received the Dark Quickening himself, he was eventually saved by Methos, though the cost was great, as during his ‘Dark Time’ Duncan had killed one of his oldest friends, Dean Burns.</p><h3>Light Quickening</h3><p>As with the Dark Quickening, the same can happen in reverse to an ‘evil’ immortal. Darius was an ancient immortal warlord who roamed the world searching for Immortals, when he came to Paris he was faced with an Immortal monk who protected Paris. Darius slew the immortal and received his Quickening, the pure, Light Quickening overcame Darius’ psyche and since then he dedicated his life to the church and spent the next thousand years on holy ground.</p><h3>Holy Ground Quickenings</h3><p>One of the three rules for Immortals, there must be no fighting on Holy Ground. This rule has been broken twice in Highlander cannon, both times with disastrous consequences.</p><p>In 79AD two immortals fought in a temple on Pompeii, when the final stroke fell the volcano erupted from the Quickening, killing the immortal victor as well. In 1993, Connor Macleod faced Kane in a Buddhist shrine, when Kane went to make the killing blow Connor blocked him with his Katana and went to finish the fight, Connor’s sword shattered to dust before making the blow. Rather than attack a defenceless man on holy ground, Kane wisely chose to save the fight for later.</p>",

It is a misconception that there were only 198 mutants with powers after M-Day, but the number is often used as a symbol of those left. The precise number of mutants left with powers after M-Day is not known, however most estimates put the total number between 200-300.</p><p>During <a href=\"/necrosha/4045-55941/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55941\">Necrosha</a> <a href=\"/caliban/4005-9637/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9637\">Caliban</a> discovered that even the dead were affected by the Scarlet Witch's spell.</p><p>For reasons currently unknown, mutants who have originated from other realities (not from the main, 616 universe), were have said to retained their powers. However, they are not included among the 198.</p><p>This is a list of all mutants confirmed to retain their powers after M-Day. <b>Mutants who were re-powered by some means after M-Day are not to be

After that, The Source plotted to remake the forth world for it though it to be flawed. Its plan was to use the Infinity man to kill all the New Gods, and merge with The Anti Life Entity, then using the soul fire equation to remake everything. Darkseid eventually discovered its plan, and was able to steal the equation and battle evenly with the then merged Source, finally trapping it. Superman went on to find where Darkseid had hidden the souls of the New Gods, and released them so the Source broke free and defeated Darkseid, then declaring it time on this plane of existence was over.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Original</h3><p>The Source originally is fully omnipresent, omniscient, and nigh omnipotent. Considered by some to be the 'Buddha' of DC, because it represents a shared cosmic consciousness in the DC Comics multiverse. It's power is far beyond even beings such as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/lucifer-morningstar/4005-24232/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24232\">Lucifer Morningstar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/michael-demiurgos/4005-12656/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12656\">Michael Demiurgos</a>. Once The Lightbringer entered its realm the Source Wall without even acknowledging The Source, but The Source's omniscience made it not interfere as it know the consequences.</p><h3>Death of New Gods</h3><p>The Death of New Gods version is weaker. Also, in that series the Anti Life is not an equation, but an entity, the dark side of the Source. It has cosmic awareness, and unlimited power capable of destroying entire universes with ease.</p><p>While investigating the death of the New Gods, Metron encountered the Anti Life Entity, and he cried because he felt the Entity's infinite power; \"I can feel the <b>limitless power</b> that is the entity. I now see what a God truly is. I've never felt so insignificant. Next to this deity, I am nothing\". Darkseid described it as; \"Call it <b>death</b>. Call it <b>Anti-Life</b>. It is beyond imagining. It is the complete unknown. It is <strong>fear.\"</strong></p>",

One of the purposes of an anthology is try out characters and determine (based on reader feedback) which ones are popular enough to host their own series. Many of the most famous comic book characters first appeared in an anthology; until the mid-60s, most of DC and Marvel's top-selling comics were anthologies.</p><p>Though anthologies fell out of fashion in American comics, they are still quite common in Europe and Asia. Generally, all of the comic volumes with the most published issues are anthologies due to the fact that a long-running anthology is made up of the individual works of hundreds of writers and artists and the volume can easily outlast all of its original contributors, several generations over. In Japan, the best-selling magazines overall tend to be manga anthologies and historically the most popular have sold millions of copies (virtually all Japanese manga is first published in anthology form before being collected).</p><p>The largest comic anthologies can have over twenty ongoing series and some of the largest are over 1000 pages per issue.</p><h3>List of Noteworthy Characters who First Appeared in Anthologies</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/batman/4005-1699/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> (<em><a href=\"/detective-comics/4050-18058/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18058\">Detective Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/captain-marvel-adventures/4050-898/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-898\">Captain Marvel</a> (<em><a href=\"/whiz-comics/4050-843/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-843\">Whiz Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/dan-dare/4005-19166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19166\">Dan Dare</a> (<em><a href=\"/eagle/4050-37583/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-37583\">Eagle</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a> (<em><a href=\"/tales-of-suspense/4050-2007/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2007\">Tales of Suspense</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/judge-dredd/4005-30061/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30061\">Judge Dredd</a> (<em><a href=\"/2000ad/4050-19752/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19752\">2000AD</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> (<em><a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> (<em><a href=\"/action-comics/4050-18005/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18005\">Action Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> (<em><a href=\"/sensation-comics/4050-18678/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18678\">Sensation Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/alan-scott/4005-12663/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12663\">Alan Scott</a> (<em><a href=\"/all-american-comics/4050-20663/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-20663\">All-American Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jay-garrick/4005-2395/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2395\">Jay Garrick</a> (<em><a href=\"/flash-comics/4050-19438/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19438\">Flash Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spectre/4005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2361\">Spectre</a> (<em><a href=\"/more-fun-comics/4050-19320/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-19320\">More Fun Comics</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/johnny-alpha/4005-44809/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44809\">Strontium Dog</a> (<em>2000AD</em>)</li><li><a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> (<em><a href=\"/journey-into-mystery/4050-1497/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1497\">Journey into Mystery</a></em>)</li><li><a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Ant-Man</a> (<em><a href=\"/tales-to-astonish/4050-2008/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2008\">Tales to Astonish</a></em>)</li></ul><h2><a href=\"/ec/4010-89/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-89\"><b>EC</b></a></h2><ul><li><em><a href=\"/crime-suspenstories/4050-1373/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1373\">Crime Suspenstories</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"/crime-suspenstories/4050-1373/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1373\">Frontline Combat</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"/haunt-of-fear/4050-1398/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-1398\">The Haunt of Fear</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"/tales-from-the-crypt-1950/4050-18612/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-18612\">Tales From the Crypt</a></em></li><li><em><a href=\"/vault-of-horror/4050-11447/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-11447\">The Vault of Horror</a></em></li></ul>",

      "deck": "The Ultraverse is the shared universe of the characters of Malibu Comics, originally known as the Megaverse. Super-powered characters were known as Ultras.",
      "description": "<p>The Ultraverse was the default setting of <a href=\"/malibu/4010-447/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-447\">Malibu</a> Comics' major series, a world in which a mysterious Entity on the Moon (the core of a crashed interdimensional spacecraft) sent outbursts of energy called the \"Jumpstart\" effect, which gave certain people superhuman powers. These beings came to be known as Ultras, the most popular and well-known of which was <a href=\"/ultraforce/4060-41810/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41810\">Ultraforce</a>. The other sources of superpowers in the Ultraverse were magic, the nanotech \"wetware\" developed by the hidden civilization of the underground-dwelling Fire People, or simply from being an alien from another planet or universe. Scientific analysis of these Ultras allowed some of these aspects to be artificially copied or genetically spliced into various human beings.</p><h2>Behind the Scenes</h2><p>The Ultraverse was fairly successful at first, even producing a short-lived Ultraforce cartoon TV series. But when <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a> bought out Malibu, the Ultraverse was radically redesigned. In the event that would come to be known as \"<a href=\"/black-september/4045-48876/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-48876\">Black September</a>\" (or B.S., to most fans) the entire continuity was rebooted. Some characters were changed or retconned out of existence, many series were canceled, and (big surprise) heroes visiting from the Marvel Universe came to dominate the remaining books. After a year and a half of this situation, Marvel finally closed down the whole company.</p><p>The Marvel Multiverse earth designation is Earth-93060.</p><h2>Possible Revival</h2><p>Steve Eagleheart was commissioned to revive the Ultraverse with the title \"The Strangers\" around 2003. However, nothing came from it.</p><p>Another possible revival of the Ultraverse and their characters has been repeatedly denied by Marvel executives. Joe Quesada explained in an interview from 2004 that the initial structure of the deal made \"next to impossible to go back and publish these books\".</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>Despite its short existence, the Ultraverse had two properties adapted to other media</p><h3><a href=\"/ultraforce/4075-818/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-818\">Ultraforce </a>(Animated Series, 1994-1995 )</h3><p>A short-lived <i>Ultraforce</i> animated television series that ran for 13 episodes, it was based on the first version of the <i>Ultraforce</i> comic book, produced by DIC Productions, L.P., and Bohbot Entertainment. The cartoon featured the roster of Prime, Hardcase, Prototype, Topaz, Ghoul, Contrary, and Pixx, with appearances of the Night Man and the Strangers.</p><h3><a href=\"/nightman/4075-817/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-817\">Night Man</a> (Live-action Series, 1997-1999)</h3><p>Adapted from the Ultraverse character, the syndicated series produced by Glen A. Larson had 2 seasons and 44 episodes. Three episodes were written by the character creator, Steve Englehart, and guest appearances by David Hasselhoff, Little Richard, and Donald Trump.</p><p>Lionsgate Entertainment released a complete series DVD in 2018. To a bigger sales impact, the box is promoted as a Marvel property, even when the whole concept was based on Malibu Comics property.</p><h2>Merchandising</h2><p>There was also an <i>Ultraforce</i> action figure line produced by Galoob. The line included a basic series with the versions of the members of the animated show and a subseries called Ultra 5000 that included alternates suits of several members and enemies.</p>",

The power also varies in levels of strength and control quite extensively. Some of the countless feats that can be performed with this power include being able to physically change the appearance of someone you touch such as creating defects (like extra digits) or even changing colors of skin, hair and eyes. To manipulate life also means to sustain it such as healing others with your touch, either from a small cut or even a removal of the heart. Things that would not naturally heal can also be cured (or bestowed) such as diseases or mental illnesses. The power can also be reversed as to manipulating life to the extent that it brings about death.</p><p><a href=\"/sersi/4005-2118/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2118\">Sersi</a> is renown amongst the Eternals as being the most-skilled manipulator of matter, this includes both organic and inorganic matter meaning she can rearrange it on a whim.

This projection is usually in the form razor sharp projectiles capable of doing an extent of damage or even as bones which can be used as blunt weapons such as plates or spikes and even more complicated forms. It also can allow the rearrangement of one's own bones and makes the bearer of this power stronger due to the fact that their bones can become much denser than normal humans and heal faster as well as form a personal armor around the user to protect them from harm. <a href=\"/kimimaro/4005-44262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44262\">Kimimaro</a> is a prime example of bone manipulation as he has utter control of his entire skeletal structure.

This energy then becomes a part of the being who usually converts it into superhuman strength, durability and/or growing in size. The energy can be stored within one's body, though for how long this can be done is a variating factor. In Marvel's Ultimate Universe, Lord <a href=\"/apocalypse/4005-7612/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7612\">Apocalypse</a> is a valiant foe and proved his power when cops shot at him with relentless gunfire.

He can then release this energy either in the form of concussive blasts or use it to increase his strength up to ten times its original limit. <a href=\"/strong-guy/4005-7599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7599\">Strong Guy</a> is X-Factor's strong guy and is super-humanly strong, however if he comes into contact with kinetic energy he will temporarily increase his strength based on the amount of energy.</p><p>However, this strength must then be released within fifty seconds or it will leave him deformed, as his muscles get larger as he gets stronger. This increase of muscle mass also provides more durability and as such makes gunfire harmless to him. <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/4005-2175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2175\">Sebastian Shaw</a> is renown for his power to absorb kinetic energy (as well as electrical) and then store it up so that it can build up continuously.

His cousin, <a href=\"/she-hulk/4005-1449/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1449\">She-Hulk</a> who received a blood transplant from him, is also incredibly strong, but her strength doesn't vary depending on her emotional state. <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> possesses an incredibly high level strength because of his godly status as the son of <a href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\">Odin</a>, All-father of Asgard, and <a href=\"/gaea/4005-15778/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15778\">Gaea</a>, Elder Goddess of Earth, which makes him the strongest of the Asgardians.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>, who is the strongest Olympian and the Olympian god of strength, was conceived by <a href=\"/zeus/4005-10226/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10226\">Zeus</a>, All-father of Olympus, and a mortal woman to be the physically stronger than the gods. <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a> has this ability, but because his Atlantean heritage, he is stronger when he is covered in water. He is still very strong out of water, but the more he dries of the more, the weaker he becomes (strength wise only). The <a href=\"/sentry/4005-1454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1454\">Sentry</a> and <a href=\"/ms-marvel/4005-21561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21561\">Ms. Marvel</a> also has incredibly high levels of superhuman strength, the first being much stronger though. But, if needed to boost their strength, these two can use their energy adsorption power to adsorb energy, using this to increase their strength.</p><p><a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> also possessed super strength when she had absorbed Ms. Marvel's powers and later <a href=\"/sunfire/4005-3175/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3175\">Sunfire</a>'s, but has now lost both these characters abilities. Another well known character with superhuman strength is the <a href=\"/thing/4005-2114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2114\">Thing</a>, who is as strong as the others that have been stated. Although when first introduced <a href=\"/molly-hayes/4005-1936/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1936\">Molly Hayes</a> could only lift a few tones, she can now lift at least one hundred tones when she toppled a gigantic monster. A side effect of this power for Molly is that she falls asleep after using her power. Her eyes also glow pink when she uses her powers. <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a> is also very strong when in his armored form, but he has been seen to be overpowered by the Hulk. Gentle has a variation of superhuman strength dubbed \"extreme strength\".</p><p><a href=\"/gentle/4005-41124/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41124\">Gentle</a> can increase the level of his physical level to a level that shouldn't even be possible. Because this increase in mass puts so much strain on his body, he has to keep it in check with vibranium tattoos. Later in his life, the tattoos will fail to keep his power under control, and he'll die. <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a> is another superhuman with strength that passes incredibly high levels, <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>, being who he is, has a very high level of superhuman strength. <a href=\"/strong-guy/4005-7599/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7599\">Strong Guy</a>, using his power mutant power, can increase his strength, but it is already at a high level.</p><p>In the DC universe, <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> has many powers including superhuman strength to an incredibly vast degree due to his Kryptonian physiology's ability to absorb, store and process yellow solar radiation. Superman's strength is dependent upon him being in reasonable proximity of a yellow sun. Superman retains his strength if he has absorbed and stored enough yellow solar radiation to maintain his strength when not in proximity of a yellow sun, though it will ebb as he expends energy. His cousins, <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"/power-girl/4005-4915/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4915\">Power Girl</a> also has this ability when under the influence of the yellow sun as well.</p><p><a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> possesses super strength granted by <a href=\"/demeter/4005-10914/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10914\">Demeter</a> (Goddess of the Earth) upon her birth. She is considered to be the strongest superhero in the DC Universe after Superman and possibly Captain Marvel (Billy Batson), making her the strongest superheroine in the DC universe. <a href=\"/donna-troy/4005-4913/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4913\">Donna Troy</a> has super strength like that of her sister <a href=\"/wonder-woman/4005-2048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2048\">Wonder Woman</a> blessed upon her by the <a href=\"/titans-of-myth/4060-54301/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54301\">Titans of Myth</a>. <a href=\"/wonder-girl/4005-10885/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10885\">Wonder Girl</a> also has strength and she was trained by the <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/4060-42494/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42494\">Amazons</a>.

So, because she was unable to cope with both powers at such a young age (telekinesis and telepathy), Professor X placed mental blocks in her mind so she couldn't access her telepathy (which she didn't know she had), and later on, he activated it, and Jean Grey is one of the most powerful telepaths in the Marvel Universe, and it is believed that one day she will surpass even Professor X himself.</p><p>Jean has been shown to use her power in more forceful ways, such as when she tore through the mental defenses of <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> after she caught her having an affair with her wife, <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>.

In general, telekinetics are the most powerful beings in existence as they have the power to manipulate matter and/or energy, the fundamental forces of the universe. One of the most powerful telekinetics in the Marvel Universe is <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a>/ <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/4005-9731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9731\">Dark Phoenix</a> who has had her powers enhanced to cosmic levels by the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a>. The <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a>'s hosts are often gifted telekinetics, including the drug-addicted youth, <a href=\"/kid-omega/4005-40583/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40583\">Kid Omega</a>. Another way for one to become a powerful telekinetic is through cloning or inheriting the trait. Such is the case of <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/4005-10981/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10981\">Madelyne Pryor</a> (the clone of Jean Grey) and <a href=\"/x-man/4005-15051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">X-Man</a> (the son of Jean Grey) who also happen to both be creations of <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mr. Sinister</a>, a fellow telekinetic. A telekinetic who has potential to be one of the greatest is the young mutant, <a href=\"/hellion/4005-40454/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40454\">Hellion</a> who often uses his powers to create force fields. Telekinetics are also commonly telepaths, as they have mastery over the mind and are provided with various abilities, such as <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>.</p><p>There are also telekinetics who are limited to only manipulating certain things, like <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto</a>, who can only manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum. In the DC Universe, notable telekinetics include <a href=\"/psimon/4005-5951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5951\">Psimon</a> and <a href=\"/raven/4005-3584/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3584\">Raven</a> who are both skilled psychics. Then there is <a href=\"/terra/4005-5307/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5307\">Terra</a> whose telekinesis is limited to effecting earth, though in itself is still a formidable force. One who is very adept at using his telekinesis, so precisely that he can slice off the top of one's skull without damaging their brain is <a href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\">Sylar</a>. <a href=\"/sylar/4005-47679/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47679\">Sylar</a> now uses his telekinesis to obtain more superpowers but it has remained his trademark ability.</p><p>His nemesis, <a href=\"/peter-petrelli/4005-47678/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47678\">Peter Petrelli</a>, is now also an experienced telekinetic thanks to his ability to use empathic power mimicry...and so this ability usually emerges in times of hatred and rage. In the Star Wars universe, telekinesis is what sets the most powerful beings apart from the ordinary civilians.

While at first it was only thought that she only had the power of invisibility it was later revealed that she could create force fields, and then it was revealed that this was all through the power of light manipulation. Invisible Woman has complete control over her power, and is probably the most powerful member of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>.

She can generate force fields to knock people back, use it to lift and move objects and as a method of transport, create disks or a forcefield around her that allows her to move through the air. She can even use them to form weapons such as swords. <a href=\"/northstar/4005-3190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3190\">Northstar</a> and <a href=\"/aurora/4005-3189/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3189\">Aurora</a>, when they were first introduced, could make contact and generate blinding flashes of light.</p><p>Later, Northstar was able to do this himself, and create force blasts or blast light that can cause concussion.

Magneto is probably the best known charcter to possess this ability in all of comics, dubbing himself “The Master of Magnitism”. Magneto is an Omega Level Mutant and is very a very powerful magnokinetic. He is also very creative in the ways he uses his powers such as creating forcefields, raising and reconstructing Asteroid M and holding it in Earth’s orbit and controlling radiation in the electromagnetic wavelength. Magneto’s daughter, Polaris, also has the ability of magnitism manipulation, but is much less powerful than her father, but powerful none the less. She lost her magnetic abilities originally after M-Day, but Apocalypse’s technology wired to her nervous system replicates her original ability and she is now more powerful than ever, and has been seen using her powers to restrain powerful combatants such as Vulcan, move and shield a spaceship, hold a ceiling up below an ocean and remove a chip from a Skrull’s brain.

Klara is from 1907, and was rescued from her abusive husband by the Runaways after Karolina witnessed the use of her powers and followed her. Klara describes her ability as “talking to [the plants]”, which is clear when she gives them verbal commands and they obey, althought this isn’t always required. It is obvious that Klara’s emotions are tied to her ability, because despite her great control over the ability, it is obvious that sometimes they overide her control. Another character with this power is Black Tom Cassidy, or at least he had it previously. Cassidy was a very powerful chlorokinetic, and gradually as his powers grew transformed into a mobile tree, and was able to reform if he was destroyed. Cassidy was also much more brutal with the use of his power, and once used it to break every bone in Squid-Boy’s body. Cornelia Hale also has this ability, but it extends beyond living plants.

He can stretch over three miles or fit himself through a pin hole, or even smaller. He could also expand just one part of his body or he could expand his organs so he is able to have a longer breath.

Say, if the transmutation requires that someone simply change a log to a wooden horse, you would need a certain type of circle for it to be effective.</p><p>However, there are still multiple ways in which some people may bypass these laws, such as Ed and Izumi Curtis (the Elric brother's mentor and a respectable alchemist herself, though she doesn't like to use it to make her life simpler) seeing the Gate of Truth in order to become as skillful in the art as they are.</p><h2>Alchemic Laws</h2><p>Though at first the power of Alchemy may seem unlimited, there are certain physical laws that it cannot bypass by any normal means. To transmute something into something else, it must have the same properties (i.e. the log and wooden horse) and equally importantly they need to be of the same mass. It is against the laws to transmute a log into an entire cabin, for example.</p><p>The Alchemical transmutations are all based off of the four elements fire, wind, water, earth, and the circles they are placed in. All of these things heavily affect the outcome of the item. In example, say a certain circle can change a piece of iron into a hammer, and another would turn it into a spear.</p><h2>Alchemic Exceptions</h2><p>There are a certain exceptions to the entire necessity of a transmutation circle as a whole. First off, there is <a href=\"/edward-elric/4005-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45359\">Edward Elric</a>, the Fullmetal alchemist. He can use Alchemy without use of a transmutation circle because he has done the unthinkable by attempting to bring back human life. Because of this, <a href=\"/edward-elric/4005-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45359\">Edward Elric</a> was sent to \"The Gate\" and saw \"Truth\", a strange malevolent being that took what he wanted when he wanted. Also, Izumi Curtis, <a href=\"/edward-elric/4005-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45359\">Edward Elric</a>'s teacher, has use of this along with his brother <a href=\"/alphonse/4005-49317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49317\">Alphonse</a>, who has also seen \"Truth\".</p><p>Along with seeing \"Truth\", there is also another way to use Alchemy in an instant way: the use of transmutation Circles on your arms or hands at all times. This is what Colonel <a href=\"/roy/4005-49318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49318\">Roy</a> Mustang does to shoot the flames out of his gloves through the air and friction, a very strategic move for combat.</p><p>There is also one other way to gain power of Alchemy and bypass the laws, and that was by using the legendary artifact: The Philosopher's stone. This legendary artifact is very elusive and it seems that no one has been able to find it...it is wondered if it even exists.</p><p>There are many Alchemists in the Fullmetal Alchemist world that can perform Alchemy, also known as the devil's magic. Many people, like the Ishbalans, believe that it is an unholy act against the Gods to change an objects form or shape, like <a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a>, the Ishbalan serial killer who is currently targeting the <a href=\"/state-alchemists/4060-50153/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50153\">State Alchemists</a> all across Central due to his holy beliefs of the God of Ishbala.</p><h2>Notable Users</h2><p><a href=\"/edward-elric/4005-45359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45359\">Edward Elric</a>- he is able to use Alchemy without a transmutation circle, as he saw \"Truth\" when he went through the gate after he tried to bring his mother Back to life...at the expense of his left leg. He would later lose his arm by trying to save his brother <a href=\"/alphonse/4005-49317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49317\">Alphonse</a> Elric, as rather than him losing a limb like Ed did, <a href=\"/alphonse/4005-49317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49317\">Alphonse</a> lost his whole body.</p><p><a href=\"/roy/4005-49318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49318\">Roy</a>-uses the transmutation circles on his gloves and the friction from when he snaps his fingers to create fire in dry air. He is all but useless in the rain.</p><p><a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a> - his right arm is not his, it was his older brothers, who made his entire body a transmutation circle before the entire Ishbalan race was destroyed. Scar attempted to fight one of the (insane) <a href=\"/state-alchemists/4060-50153/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50153\">State Alchemists</a> as they ran from the attackers, and with two swipes of his finger his forehead basically exploded into the scar we see today. He would later lose his arm to the same <a href=\"/state-alchemists/4060-50153/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50153\">State Alchemists</a>, and his brother , knowing death was only a few hours away, <a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a>'s brother took off his own arm and attached it to <a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a> with Alchemy. This is one reason that <a href=\"/scar/4005-49319/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49319\">Scar</a> hates alchemy, but uses it, as his brother died from blood loss shortly after.</p><p><a href=\"/alphonse/4005-49317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49317\">Alphonse</a> was originally just like any other alchemist, albeit slightly better due to the fact that alchemy kept him alive. However, after seeing one of his closest friends die, he was able to understand the Gate of Truth, the very same one which Ed saw when he tried to bring their mother back to life. This now allows for Al to use Alchemy without a circle, just like Izumi Curtis and Ed.</p><h2>Equivalent Exchange</h2><p>Equivalent Exchange was the idea from the anime of the Fullmetal Alchemist series that most alchemists referred to when explaining the laws of alchemy and in many forms of trade in real life, always saying that in order for them to do something they need the right materials. In essence, they meant that a river couldn't come from a raindrop, at least. not from them.</p><p>They would need the appropriate amount of a certain element before attempting a transmutation at all, if not, the transmutation would simply cancel out, or, in much more serious attempts, the effects would be much, much more drastic, such as losing organs like Ed and Al and Izumi did in their try at bringing a human being back to life. This resulted in a lot of things happening, but none of them being positive to the slightest extent.</p><p>In the anime, an attempt like this simply made a homologous, but it has nothing to do with that as far as we know in the manga series, and doesn't even seem to really make an indifference, as the things that people have always brought back, as far as Ed and Al know, have only been random human parts, only barely even resembling the original person at all. In fact, Ed was put through much hardship when he discovered that the thing that he brought back from the dead was not his mother at all, meaning that the equivalent exchange didn't exist in that trade at all, giving him nothing and taking nearly everything.</p>",

When a Soul Reaper unleashes their Zanpakuto from it's sealed form to the Shikai release form they invoke a new level of power.</p><h2>Evidence of Increase</h2><p>When a Soul Reaper uses their Shikai release the Soul Reaper gains the ability to raise different areas of their abilities. Some may become faster, others stronger, but on top of that the Zanpakuto also reveals itself to everyone in its second and more complete form. Some character's Zanpakuto gets larger in size while others get smaller.</p><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>The Shikai release is controlled by the wielder and can only be engaged by the release phrase that the Zanpakuto's owner calls out. The release phrase also reveals the character of the Zanpakuoto. An example of that is Kisuke Urahara using Benihime, whose release phrase is \"Awaken.\" The call differs by the users. This proves that the true power of Benihime is easily locked away and has to be brought out for its full use. Some Zanpakuto remain in Shikai state like Ichigo Kurosaki's.</p>",

The Bankai also alters the form of the Zanpaku- to, but it also can alter the way the wielder appears. Ichigo and Renji both change in appearance and power whereas Byakuya's Zanpaku to changes but he doesn't.</p><h2>How Does It Work?</h2><p>Like the Shikai release the wielder utters their release command while connecting with their Zanpaku- to's spirit. The complete union of the two gives them their full power and opens up several new levels to their attacks too. The true form of the Zanpaktou and has immense power. For the most part, only Lieutenant level and higher Shinigami have obtained this level because of the immense time it takes to train to call out the true power of the sword. The powers, form, and limit, greatly depend on the soul, spirit energy, and personality of the wielder. But also depends on the sword itself. As seen with Ichigo Kurosaki, one must become one with their Bankai to finally release it. The shinigami must search deep in themselves and defeat the Bankai as a physical being to be able to use this power. </p>",

      "description": "<a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Description</h2><p>When a Shaman is not capable of doing something themselves they will find a strong spirit ally that they can combine with to make the task simpler for themselves.  Different Shaman use different mediums of spirits to integrate with.  Many Shaman will use human ghost because of how much easier they are to work with, but some shamans use higher spirits to combine with.  The problem with higher spirits though are that they are a lot more independent than a human ghost.  When using a higher spirit the person is more likely to be controlled and become a vessel for that spirit.</p><a href=\"///\"></a><h2>Process</h2><p>When Integrating the host has to open up their body to the spirit they are bringing into them.  By doing so they allow the spirit so much control over the body, and th more control they give to the spirit the more effect the spirit can perform.  Sometimes the fusion means using someone else's body too though.  Characters like Tao Jun will fuse a soul with it's own dead body, making a Jiang- si, because it takes no energy to create the fusion.  Other people may use non human creatures to bond a soul too, that way they can use the experience from the spirit in something less experienced.  Ren does this to integrate Bason's old horse's spirit with his own horse so that the new horse will know how to best react under Bason's technique.</p>",

      "description": "<p>There are hundreds to thousands of jutsu in the Narutoverse that involve anything from crushing people with sand to cloning yourself with the energy. These jutsu require hand-signs and focusing <a href=\"../../chakra/12-46239/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chakra</a> to make them work. Jutsus that don't require hand signs-are uncommon.</p><p>There are 12 hand-seals, each one named after an animal in the Chinese zodiac. Each hand-seals deals with a specific use (for examples: the Tiger hand-seal is often used for Katons and the Snake for Dotons) and thus numerous hand-seals are sometimes required for a single technique to get the desired outcome. Kakashi's \"Chidori\" for example requires the combination of Ox Rabbit Monkey, in that order.</p><p>There are five types of jutsu: Ninjutsu, the basic power arts... think \"magic\" in a sense; Taijutsu, martial arts that don't require any hand signs to complete; Genjutsu, illusionary techniques where by manipulating anothers' five senses through controlling their flow of chakra to the brain; Fuuinjutsu, drawing symbols which act similarly to ninjutsu; and Kuchiyose, the ability to warp time &amp; space to summon aid in battle.</p><p>Elemental jutsu are divided into five categories: Katon (fire release), Fuuton (wind release), Raiton (lightning release), Doton (earth release), and Suiton (water release). Each one beats the one to it's right and loses to it's left, thus having water circle around into beating fire. People in the Narutoverse are born with a specific elemental affinity, allowing them to learn that element easier than any other and use more powerful jutsus with that element than any other. Using different elemental jutsus is done by recomposing their chakra into the element they want, which is not easy to learn.</p><p>A key way to find out what elemental affinity a ninja has is by holding a piece of paper and focusing their chakra into it and watch what happens: Katon causes the paper to burn, Fuuton causes the paper to tear, Raiton causes the paper to crinkle, Doton causes the paper to crumble, and Suiton causes the paper to moisten.</p><p>There are also cerain types of techniques called Kekkai Genkai, it literally means \"blood-line trait\" and only members of a certain family can use it; like <a href=\"../../kimimaro/29-44262/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kimimaro</a> and his bone manipulation ability, or <a href=\"../../sasuke/29-44241/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sasuke</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-44260\" href=\"/itachi-uchiha/4005-44260/\">Itachi's</a> Sharingan eyes, or others such as The Third Kazekage possessed the ability to alter his chakra into magnetic fields and control metal. There are also Kekkei Genkais that gives the user dual affinities, which can be combined by the user to create a new element, such as in the case of <a href=\"../../haku/29-44244/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Haku</a> whom can use Hyouton (ice release) ninjutsu by combining Suiton and Fuuton, or <a href=\"../../the-first-hokage/29-49812/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The First Hokage</a> whom could use Mokuton (wood release) ninjutsu by combining Doton and Suiton.</p><p>Ok guys, I'll do my best to list these as efficiently as possible by splitting them into specific groups (Note: The Kekkai Genkai are only the jutsu that are enabled by the kekkai genkai-NOT the item itself, like the <a href=\"../../sharingan/18-44263/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sharingan</a> eyes or the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Byakugan</a>; these have separate pages for a reason).</p><p><b>SPOILERS BELOW</b></p><h2>Ninjutsu</h2><h3><u><b>A</b></u></h3><p>Act of Tree Walking: A basic jutsu where by focusing chakra a ninja is able to scale virtually any surface.</p><p>Used By: Everyone</p><p>Act of Water Walking: A basic jutsu where by focusing chakra a ninja is able to stand on top of water.</p><p>Used By: Everyone</p><p>Adamantine Staff: Transforms the user into a nearly indestructible, size-altering rod.

They do not need chakra, but their strength can be enhanced by the use of chakra in the blows. Some taijutsu however do require the use of chakra to be effective.</p><p>Front Lotus: This Taijutsu attack is a very dangerous attack which needs the release of your first <a href=\"../../chakra/12-46239/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chakra</a> Gate. It is one of the most common attacks employed by Rock <a href=\"../../lee/29-44527/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lee</a>, but it has also been used by <a href=\"../../might-guy/29-48904/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Might Guy</a> and <a href=\"../../kakashi/29-44243/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kakashi</a>. It is a two part attack, each of which is listed below:</p><ul><li><p>Shadow of the Dancing Leaf: The shadow of the Dancing leaf is a quick upward kick into an opponent's chin, vaulting them into the air, where the user will then quickly jump up behind them, making any defense by the enemy difficult.</p></li><li><p>Pile driver: In this step, the person employing the use of this Jutsu will wrap something around the opponent (in the case of <a href=\"../../lee/29-44527/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lee</a>, he uses his arm bandages). The employer of the Jutsu will the wrap their arms around their opponent, and begin spinning them rapidly towards the ground. Right before impact, The employer will then kick off of the opponent, and the Opponent will land head-first into the ground, causing serious harm to the enemy.</p></li><li><p>Used By: Lee</p></li></ul><p>The full Front lotus is a B-rank attack</p><p>Gentle Fist: This Technique is a fighting style meant to be incorporated with the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Byakugan</a> eye, and is taught to every member of the Hyuga clan. Using the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Byakugan</a>, the user locates the chakra points in the opponents body and uses multiple strikes to each point to block it off. This leaves the opponent unable to use his Chakra, and leaving him defenseless from any future attack.</p><p>Used By: Hinata, Hiashi, Neji</p><p>Lion Barrage: This Jutsu is an attack created by Uchiha <a href=\"../../sasuke/29-44241/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sasuke</a> after seeing the Front Lotus. The beginning of the attack is the same as that of the Front Lotus, using the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf, but instead of following it up with a pile driver, the user attacks the opponent with a barrage of attacks, the first one a strike to the side (Mean to be blocked), before following it up with two hand strikes. The final attack is a kick to the stomach, sending the opponent into the ground at high speeds. The Lion Barrage is a C-rank attack.</p><p>Used By: Sasuke</p><p>Morning Peacock: The user moves their fists so fast that they create fire from the friction, enhancing the power of the strikes.</p><p>Used By: Gai</p><p>Noon Tiger: This uses wind pressure in the shape of a tiger's head to attack the opponent, it condenses into a single point and then explodes.</p><p>Used By: Gai</p><p>Reverse Lotus: This technique is one of the most dangerous Taijutsu techniques, needing for the opening of at least three chakra gates, which is in itself a feat. The user will then launch their enemy into the air, and following them, delivering a shattering blow which will launch them into the ground, usually being fatal to the opponent. The attack is a gamble, though, since the releasing of so many Chakra Gates at once will leave the user drained and very susceptible to attack.</p><p>Used By: Lee</p><p>Then, of course, there are the techniques that require no chakra at all, mainly because they are not taught anywhere and do not really provide an edge in any fight. These are the simple taijutsu moves that are more like brawling then they are martial arts, like Naruto's star kick that seemed never to fail to get him into a battle, and get the upperhand at the same time. Naruto used some techniques that never seemed to be anything like martial arts for the duration of part I. Then there were Itachi's kicks that, unseemingly, were really just brute force and no real graceful intent behind them.</p><h2>Eight Gates</h2><p>They are eight important chakra points in the body. This is what limits the chakra in your body. So if you use it you have limits. After you use this it makes your body weaker. If you uses this you can pass the normal physical standards, but have extreme pain to the body. Rock Lee is one who can open open the 5 gates only for now. Might Guy, the one who even taught Lee about this, can open 6. Kakashi Hatake can only open 1, this is proven because while he was rock climbing it shows in his brain the first gate activating.</p><h3>The First Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Opening, this frees the brain limit on all the strains and muscles, giving the user 5 times more speed and strength.</p><h3>The Second Gate</h3><p>This is called the Gate of Rest, you release the brain limit on your stamina, If the user was exhausted and ready to quit in an instant he would want to fight like the fight didn't even start yet.</p><h3>The Third Gate</h3><p>This is called the Gate of Life, this gate is in your spinal cord, and frees the limit to your nervous system through out your body. This makes information faster and builds more stamina. The side-effect of this is your body's skin will turn red because your building your blood-oxygen rate.</p><h3>The Fourth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Pain, It releases the limit oxygen going to your lungs, making more oxygen for the users body to use.</p><h3>The Fifth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Closing, this frees the amount of chakra you can use in one attack, this allows you to move the speed of sound.</p><h3>The Sixth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Joy, this takes away the amount of fat and protein your body can digest. And releasing useless energy resources giving the person more power and more stamina.</p><h3>The Seventh Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Shock, this takes away the amount your body can move, it takes away your dead skin cells to fences and refresh your system making your body more power and more stamina.</p><h3>The Eighth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Death, this is the last gate, it is at the heart and uses your whole body's energy, it makes your heart pump at its fullest speed and passes all the 1-7 gates. It uses every cell in your body. There is side-effect of this called the Big Bang it kills every muscle in the body and the heart. Its a certified death on the user if the Gate of Death is ever opened.</p><p><b>Used by:</b> Lee &amp; Might Guy &amp; Kakashi</p>",

Small parts of the equation, when viewed, can also endow limited elements of the power into those who view it.</p><p>The Creation Equation creates godlike nigh-omnipotence in its human host. The host is capable of teleportation, reality alteration, reanimation of the dead (with no apparent ill effects to the reanimated individual), and numerous other abilities.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Homunculus is a term generally used in various <span>fields of study</span> to refer to any representation of a small human being. Popularized in 16th century <a href=\"/alchemy/4015-50042/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50042\">alchemy</a> and 19th century fiction, it has historically referred to the creation of a miniature, fully formed human. Currently, in scientific fields, a homunculus may refer to any scale model of the human body that, in some way, illustrates <span>physiological</span>, <span>psychological</span>, or other abstract human characteristics or functions.</p><p>Homunculi have made numerous appearances throughout fiction, such as those in the <a href=\"/fullmetal-alchemist/4050-50835/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-50835\">Fullmetal Alchemist</a> manga and animes, <a href=\"/buso-renkin/4050-50373/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-50373\">Buso Renkin</a>, or other such series.</p><p> </p><h2>Fullmetal Alchemist</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-homunculi/4060-50545/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-50545\">See The Homunculli page for more info.</a></p><p> </p><h2>Buso Renkin</h2><p>The Homunculi are creatures created by using alchemy on the cells of an already living creature and injecting the cells into a human body. This process is made possible through the use of carrier embryos which enter the body and make their way to the brain, where they turn the human they have infected into a Homunculus. If the embryo is implanted directly into the brain, then the transformation will be almost instantaneous and almost painless, but if the embryo were to be injected at any other part of the body, it will cause severe pain to the person as it makes its way up to the brain. After the creature has become a homunculus, they gain many different powers, including invulnerability, healing, immortality, super strength, super speed, and a need to eat humans.</p><p>There are three different types of Homunculus:</p><h3>Animal-Type Homunculus</h3><p>The Animal-Type Homunculus is the weaker of the two types, resulting when the carrier embryo is implanted with the cells of an animal and implanted into a human. When this happens, the human will be capable of transforming into the form of the animal from which the cells were taken, as well as being able to transform into a human. This transformation is severely harmful to the human host though, causing them to die, and their brain to be taken over by the experiences and instincts of the donor animal. The Animal-Type Homunculi become amazingly loyal to the human that created them, much as a pet becomes loyal to its owner, though some seem to be less loyal than others. Their power is entirely dependent on their animal and on their own will (as demonstrated by Kawazui’s being beaten by <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> Muto, but Washio being able to battle both <a href=\"/kazuki/4005-51727/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51727\">Kazuki</a> and Tokiko on equal terms).</p><h3>Plant-Type Homunculus</h3><p>The Plant-Type Homunculi occur when the cells of a plant are placed into the carrier embryo. The Plant Type Homunculi are very similar to the Animal-Type Homunculi, as both have both a human and a “natural” form, and both the Animal and Plant-Types’ power is entirely based on their own strength and determination. The Plant-Type Homunculus are also arguably the easiest type of Homunculus to make, as Papillon’s first successful Homunculus was a Plant-Type, but this may also have only been a coincidence.</p><h3>Human-Type Homunculus</h3><p>The Human-Type Homunculi are the most powerful type of Homunculi, due to their ability to use the Kakugane, an ability reserved for humans. The Human-Type Homunculi are created when a Human uses his own cells in the carrier embryo, and he would then implant this embryo into their own body. This causes them to gain all the powers of a Homunculus without their minds being destroyed. In other words, they are able to keep their memories, their thought processes, and their ambitions.</p>",

The first firebenders, the Sun Warriors, were able to discover their abilities by studying the world’s natural fire benders, the dragons. Firebenders have shown themselves capable of using fire from various parts of their bodies, including, the hand, feet, and mouth, but to a rarer extent. Firebending seems to require steady breathing, or else the bender can lose control of their fire. Firebenders have shown shown themselves capable of propelling in the air through use of fire, but in only small bursts, as demonstrated by Azula.</p><p>During Sozin's Comet, firebenders are at their peak. Iroh, by himself, was capable of sending a giant ball of flame to burst a hole in Ba Sing Se's wall. Firebenders ( like Ozai) have themselves to be able to continuously float in the air and propel themselves by using fire coming from their feet. The fire formed by Sozin's comet has a significant reach compared to regular firebending.</p><p>Firebender also have different colors for fires. Traditional fire is red/orange. One exception is Azula's, who's fire is blue ( although it was the traditional color when she was younger.) Her seems to be more concussive as it was capable of busting through a wall of earth created by Aang. Varying colors seem to mean varying strengths.</p><p>The true nature of Firebending was hidden by fire lord Sozin when he began his war against the other nations. He instead began teaching all those under his control that the true power from the fire nation lay in their rage, and began making them angry at the other nations.</p><p>Firebending is based on the martial artist’s style of Northern Shaolin, focusing on strong kicks and long ranged attacks. However, they are also very capable of fighting close range with swift punches and jabs. The true strength of a firebender, though, is in their amazing speed and precision, and prodigal firebenders have been shown to be able to escape from four other capable benders without damage to themselves.</p><p><b>Lightningbending</b></p><p>Lightningbending, also known as the Cold blooded fire, is one of the most deadly</p><figure style=\"width: 270px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-328661\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10390/328661-43463-benders.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.67777777777778\" data-width=\"270\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10390/328661-43463-benders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-328661\"><img alt=\"Lightning Bending\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328661-43463-benders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328661-43463-benders.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px\" data-width=\"270\"></a><figcaption>Lightning Bending</figcaption></figure><p>techniques available to a firebender. To bend lightning, a firebender must let go of all of their emotions, and then attempt to separate their good side from their bad side, their yin from their yang. However, due to the fact that the two are connected, they will eventually crash back together, and lightning is created. The Lightning is nearly impossible to survive, but this power is not at the mercy of the user. The user can only guide it out of them, and the lightning shall carve its own path through the air.</p><p>However, it is possible to redirect lightning. The technique for doing so was created by the amazing firebender <a href=\"/uncle-iroh/47559/\" data-ref-id=\"47559\">Iroh</a> as he watched waterbenders. To due so, one must guide the energy that the lightning creates through your hand, down your arm, through your stomach, and then out your other hand, sending the lightning away from you. However, if it were to go through your heart, then it would cause too much damage, making it deadly to the user. This makes this technique impressively deadly, but a true master can do it without fear of harming themselves.</p><h2>Earthbending</h2><p>Iroh’s words of wisdom on the Earth Kingdom:</p><blockquote>”Earth is the element of substance.

It focus’s on having a strong, solid base that makes it almost impossible to move the earthbender when they are fighting. They are capable of moving unbelievable amounts of earth, making them unbelievably dangerous. Earthbenders have shown they can move through the ground as if it was air, and are more attuned to the air as well. Earthbenders can also bend mud ( since it's earth and water), and sand, but as shown by Toph, it isn't the easiest transition, although she becomes skillful enough in it to create a replica of Ba Sing Se, including some citizens.</p><p><b>Metalbending</b></p><p>Metalbending is a subsection of Earthbending that appears to have been created</p><figure style=\"width: 300px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-328687\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-328687\"><img alt=\"Discovering Metal bending\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Discovering Metal bending\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10390/328687-131203-benders.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Discovering Metal bending</figcaption></figure><p>by the blind Earthbender Toph. Due to metal being a purified form of earth, Toph was able to discover the impurities in the metals by using vibrations. Then, by bending these small impurities, Toph was able to bend the metal, effectively becoming the first ever Metal Bender.</p><p>The fact that it is possible to bend metal is of serious danger to those who attempt to imprison such a metalbender, as it used to be thought that imprisoning an earthbender was to keep them surrounded by something they could not bend, namely metal.</p><p>Though Toph does appear to be the only character capable of metalbending, it is very possible that <a href=\"/king-bumi/4005-52623/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52623\">King Bumi</a> can actually bend metal, since he was shown bending while in a metal cage. However, his only comment about bending with his face makes this very unlikely. Aang can possibly bend metal in the future, seeing as though he has the same seismic sense Toph has (from training with her) and knows that even metal has some Earth inside it.</p><p>In the recent Avatar comics by <a href=\"/dark-horse-comics/4010-364/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-364\">Dark Horse</a>, Toph has created an academy to teach young earthbenders the art of metalbending.

An Airbender usually attempts to avoid al assaults sent their way, and will usually attempt to just wait for an opening in their opponent’s defense. The biggest advantage that they held in a fight was their inhuman speed, caused by their ability to manipulate the air around them. They were also able to summon great gusts, and some were even powerful enough to summon giant hurricanes. Airbenders had the capability to be some of the deadliest benders, due to the abundancy of air, their quick movements, and the capability of creating miniature tornadoes/twisters, funnels, slices of air capable of cutting rock etc. However, sue to their pacifistic nature, they don't do such things.</p><p>Airbenders have a great variety of offensive and defensive techniques, such as creating shields of air, concussive blasts shaped like the bender's body, and so on. Passively, they can run on water (because they're so fast) run up walls, and create air cushions to slow themselves down as they're in the air, so they don't the ground hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Air Nomads were all killed at the beginning of the war between the Fire Nation and the rest of the world.

They discovered the other four bending arts, and over time knowledge of Energybending was almost completely lost. The last known keeper of the art was an ancient Lion Turtle , who later passed it down to Avatar Aang who used it to remove Ozai's firebending forever.</p><p>The capabilities of Energybending are not well understood; what is known is that bending a person's life energy can impart them with knowledge instantly or remove one's bending completely. This bending art is dissimilar to the others because it is so perilous to the user, which is why so few have ever used it.</p><h3>Dangers</h3><p>Energybending is an extremely powerful and potentially dangerous technique. If the bender's spirit is even slightly weak (bendable), then they will be infected by the spirit of the one they are bending. As a result the bender can be corrupted and even killed.</p><h3>Don’t underestimate the avatar</h3><p>The Avatar is a special bender, with the ability to bend every element. It is an Avatar's duty to master each element, and keep peace throughout the world.

The judges select from entries submitted to them by creators and publishers as well as any works not submitted they see as noteworthy. The judge's nominations are sent out to members of the comics industry to select a winner. Four or five candidates are nominated per category for work released in the prior year with the exception of the Hall of Fame. Inductees into the Hall of Fame are chosen from a list of around 16 candidates, typically two candidates are inducted by the judges and four are voted in by the industry voters.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><h3>The Force</h3><p>The<a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-force/4015-50253/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\"> Force</a> is a mystical energy that binds together all life and matter in the galaxy. Though the Force flows through all living beings, it can only be harnessed and controlled by beings known as \"Force-sensitives.\" Force-sensitivity was correlated with and sometimes attributed to a high count of symbiotic and supposedly intelligent microorganisms called midi-chlorians that were found in a Force-sensitive's blood; the higher the count, the greater the being's potential Force ability.</p><p>Force-sensitive beings were able to tap into the Force to perform acts of great skill, strength, and agility as well as control and shape the world around them.</p><h3>The Light Side of the Force</h3><p>The light side of the Force was concerned with ideals of peace, knowledge, benevolence, and healing. Followers of the light side strove to live in harmony with the world around them, acting out of wisdom and logic rather than emotion and haste. In order to achieve a relationship with the light side of the Force, its practitioners would often meditate to clear themselves of emotion, particularly negative emotions such as fear and anger.</p><p>The largest group of proponents and teachers of the light side was the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jedi-order/4060-41234/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41234\">Jedi Order</a>, who strove to maintain peace and justice throughout the galaxy. The values of the light side were culminated in the Jedi Code. The Jedi accepted the view that there were two sides of the Force: the dark side and the light side. A follower of the light side used the Force for defense and knowledge. Mutual trust, respect, and the ability to form alliances gave the Jedi distinct advantages over the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/the-sith/4060-44460/\">Sith</a>.</p><p>Traditional Jedi were keen to keep the Force \"in balance.\" They attempted to achieve this by destroying the Sith and denying the dark side entirely—essentially keeping balance by restoring the Force to its natural state, the light side, since they viewed the dark side as a perversion. This involved the purging of negative emotions such as fear, anger, and hatred as such emotions could seduce the user to the dark side. In contrast, positive emotions such as compassion and courage nurtured the light side of the Force.</p><p>Passion was considered dangerous as it could lead to strong emotions that could destabilize the Jedi's mind and lead them to the dark side. Love was, curiously enough, seen as something both Jedi and Sith avoided. While the Jedi espoused a broad, all-encompassing, self-sacrificing love for all beings, love for another being—romance, a possessive love by nature—was prohibited in post-Ruusan order. The Jedi viewed love as a risk best left untouched. The passion that came with love could lead to hatred and anger, as <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-vader/4005-6342/\">Anakin Skywalker</a> demonstrated by becoming a Sith due in large part to his love for <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/padme-amidala/4005-6343/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6343\">Padmé Amidala</a>.</p><p>Possession of material things was also prohibited in the post-Ruusan Reformation era Jedi Order, with the only exceptions being the Jedi's <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/lightsaber/4055-44097/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-44097\">lightsaber</a>, clothes, and other bare necessities.</p><h3>The Dark Side of the Force</h3><p>The dark side of the Force was considered by the Jedi to be a corruption of the Force aligned with fear, hatred, malice, and selfishness. Such negative emotions seemed to increase the strength and abilities of a user of the dark side, providing a path towards personal power and the destruction or control of all opposition. It was generally accepted that use of the dark side of the Force was extremely addictive. The primary users and supporters of the dark side were the Sith.</p><p>Although at one time being the name of a primitive humanoid species native to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/korriban/4020-57442/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57442\">Korriban</a>, the Sith became an order of dark side Force-users who aimed to forcibly take control of the galaxy and reshape it in their image. Some users of the dark side did not affiliate themselves with the Sith and were collectively branded Dark Jedi. Some light Jedi, such as Jaden Korr and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/secret-apprentice/4005-49602/\">Galen Marek</a>, could use dark side powers while resisting the temptation of the dark side.</p><p>The Dark Lord <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-bane/4005-44794/\">Darth Bane</a> considered the Force to be finite and thus ideal for exclusive use by the Dark Lord. He eliminated the practice of having vast numbers of Sith at the same time, thereby aiming to concentrate the dark side of the Force into two individuals: a Sith Master and his or her apprentice. This tradition, or \"<a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/rule-of-two/4015-53453/\">Rule of Two</a>,\" later underwent a small reformation by Dark Lady <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/shira-elan-colla-brie/4005-63956/\">Lumiya</a> following the deaths of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164/\">Darth Sidious</a> and Darth Vader in 4 ABY. The Rule of Two was later rejected by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-krayt/4005-45364/\">Darth Krayt</a>, who instituted the Rule of One, with \"One\" referring to the Sith Order itself and its many minions, acolytes/adepts, and lords, led by only one Dark Lord of the Sith, or Dread Lord.</p><p>Darth Krayt believed he gave the Sith and their power a purpose, unlike Darth Bane, who believed that power was the purpose. The Rule of One called for cooperation and even some level of loyalty between the Sith. However, the Rule of One did not represent the Sith as a whole, and Krayt was even labeled a heretic in the holocrons of Darth Bane, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-nihilus/4005-47874/\">Darth Nihilus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/darth-andeddu/4005-52704/\">Darth Andeddu</a>.</p><p>Use of the dark side of the Force was strictly forbidden within the Jedi Order.</p><h3>The Living Force</h3><p>The Living Force was the most prominent philosophy of the Jedi. Proponents of the Living Force thought that the Force flowed through all living brings, and thus connected them both directly and indirectly. As such, Jedi believing in this ideology were very aware and mindful of living beings around them. They displayed the utmost level of empathy and mercy. They also emphasized the importance of dealing with the present rather than worrying about the future or brooding over the past.</p><p>However, this leads to a propensity to act impulsively and passionately. As such, it was widely believed that the Living Force shared both light and dark side qualities. Followers of the Living Force had to be wary of the pull of the dark side, which could be particularly strong in followers of this philosophy.</p><p>Qui-Gon Jinn, a notable follower of the Living Force, was able to rediscover the ability to retain one's identity after death by means of a Force ghost. This allowed Jedi to spiritually manifest themselves and interact with the physical world.</p><h3>The Unifying Force</h3><p>The Unifying Force was a much rarer interpretation of the Force. Followers of the Unifying Force believed that the Force was a single, neutral entity seemingly incapable of deciphering between good and evil, lacking a distinct \"dark\" or \"light\" side. Adherents to this philosophy were very concerned with the future and prophetic visions.</p><p>It is believed that Grand Master Yoda, who was famous for his constant mindfulness of the future, was a proponent of this philosophy. Many dark side Force-users such as Darth Sidious also supported this concept claiming that the Force truly was an impartial deity. The key difference between the Jedi and Sith variants was the proper use of this supposed force of nature. The Sith saw it as a tool fit only for personal power gain, while the Jedi saw it as a means to foresee events, gain knowledge, and avert crises.</p><h3>Potentium</h3><p>The Potentium was a relatively rare perspective of the Force that claimed that the dark side of the Force didn't exist and that the Force as a whole was naturally righteous. Believers in the Potentium thought that the dark side existed only inside the individual in the form of negative emotions and evil intentions. Therefore, anyone could utilize dark side abilities so long as their intentions were just.</p><p>The Jedi viewed this idea as dangerous and insolent and as such banned the doctrine within temple walls. A notable proponent of this philosophy was the living planet Zonama Sekot.</p><h3>Beliefs of the Aing-Tii</h3><p>The Aing-Tii monks from the Kathol Rift viewed the Force in a very peculiar way. According to them, the Force didn't exist in shades of black or white, per se, but in a variety of different colors. This line of thinking extended to individuals as well, whom they believed were never totally good or evil, but were part of a broader, less definite spectrum. Because of this type of reasoning, they were able to use unique abilities that were unfamiliar to either the Jedi or the Sith.</p><h4>Force Techniques</h4><ul><li><strong>Enhance Senses</strong>: Jedi and Sith can call upon the Force to dramatically increase their senses and mental processing speeds, allowing them to see, hear, and smell things miles away, react to things such as blaster bolts, and fly a ship better than any non-Force user.</li><li><strong>Force Speed</strong>: By using the Force to alter their capabilities, Jedi and Sith can increase their physical speed to superhuman lengths, allowing them to fight at blindingly quick speeds and sometimes even vanish to the naked eye. It is a very common ability and is often used to bring a quick end to a fight. It can, however, be quite taxing on the body and prolonged usage typically requires a recovery period.</li><li><strong>Telepathy</strong>: This is a fundamental application of the Force that allows Force users to probe and manipulate another's mind. A Jedi may use this ability to calm a belligerent socialite, convince a criminal to surrender, or misdirect an evil Stormtrooper. A Sith might use this ability to instill fear in an opponent, find a hidden secret inside the mind of a prisoner, or reduce a foe to violent insanity. It is common for Jedi and Sith to form telepathic bonds with comrades where they are able to freely mentally communicate through vast distances.</li><li><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: Yet another core Force power, this is used to some degree by nearly all Force users. Force users use telekinesis to physically manipulate objects from afar. It manifests itself in a variety of ways such as Force Push and Pull. The mass of the object(s) manipulated depends on the skill, power, and mastery of the Force user. Padawans typically begin by lifting small stones or guiding sand into a bottle, but more powerful practitioners have been known to collapse entire caverns and maneuver whole Star Destroyers.</li><li><strong>Tutaminis</strong>: This ability allows the user to create a field of energy absorption. This field can vary in size, although it is commonly created around the palm. Depending on the individual, this can be used to absorb blaster bolts and even lightsabers.</li><li><strong>Force Lightning</strong>: A hallmark ability of the Sith, it allows the user to shoot bolts of thin lightning of varying intensities at a target, causing anything from excruciating pain to outright incineration. Although difficult to do so, it is possible to absorb, deflect, and even redirect Force Lightning using a lightsaber or Tutaminis. This ability, due to its destructive nature and reliance on hatred and anger, is banned from the Jedi Order.</li><li><strong>Electric Judgement</strong>: A rare and controversial light side application of Force Lightning discovered by the esteemed Jedi Master Plo Koon, it works in much the same way as standard Force Lightning, but relies on a sense of justice as opposed to hatred. It bears a signature green color that distinguishes it from the Sith variant.</li><li><strong>Precognition</strong>: A Force user can extend their perception to the flow of time itself, allowing them to sense things seconds or even minutes before they occur.</li><li><strong>Force Healing</strong>: This ability allows the user to relieve pain, mend wounds, cure illnesses, and generally heal a living target through the Force. It is primarily used by Jedi, although the Sith can utilize this ability as well. However, the dark side offers only a perversion of true Force Healing, at best only temporarily curing ailments, or at worst requiring a sacrifice of some sort.</li><li><strong>Force Choke</strong>: Also called Force Grip, this ability acts as an extension of the hand allowing the Force user to grip the trachea of their victim and strangle them to death. It was used heavily as a torture technique by the infamous Darth Vader, among many others. Its use is banned among Jedi.</li><li><strong>Force Crush</strong>: Much like Force Choke, this refinement of telekinesis allows to user to grip the target with great intensity, crushing the target. It was notably used by Master Mace Windu against General Grievous, resulting in a seemingly permanent cough and wheeze. It is rarely used by Jedi due to its barbarity.</li><li><strong>Force Storm</strong>: Although \"Force Storm\" has been used to describe great discharges of Force Lightning, it is officially a separate ability that allows the user to create a maelstrom of lightning that rips a hole in the fabric of space-time to open a hyperspace wormhole. Developed by Darth Sidious, it is the the most destructive application of the Force ever recorded. Its only known usage was by the creator himself.</li></ul><h2>The Jedi Order</h2><p>The Jedi were an ancient and widespread organization of light side Force-users that acted as peacekeepers, diplomats, and guardians, maintaining serenity and safety throughout the galaxy. The Jedi were very much respected by governments and citizens alike. While typically creating and maintaining peace through their wisdom and patience, the Jedi could enforce law and order through their martial prowess and ability to manipulate the Force.</p><p>Despite the Order's good reputation, many times in history have the people of the galaxy felt distrustful of the Jedi and their secretive institution, sometimes going as far as blaming certain conflicts and tragedies on the Jedi.</p><h3>The Jedi</h3><p>To become a Jedi, one must possess Force-sensitivity and be discovered by a Jedi. Prior to the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/great-jedi-purge/4045-56996/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56996\">Great Jedi Purge</a>, the Jedi Order had designated Jedi recruiters whose duty was to track down undiscovered Force-sensitives, but the job was considered undesirable by many due to the unpleasant reality of taking a child away from his/her family. Other Jedi on missions might happen upon Jedi potentials and could report their findings to the Order. Regardless of the method of discovery, the Jedi would observe and study the Force-sensitive, determining whether or not they bore the necessary qualities and lacked certain unfavorable attributes such as aggression and fearfulness.</p><p>Once the Jedi decided that the Force-sensitive was acceptable, their training began. The Jedi would commence their training at the rank of Initiate. They were expected to wear a neutral color tunic, complete with a belt and boots. Their studies would revolve around the Three Pillars of the Jedi: Force, Knowledge, and Self-Discipline. The Pillar of the Force involved studying the many aspects and interpretations of the Force, the history of the Force, the Jedi Code, and the Force itself via many rudimentary abilities such as tutaminis, altus sopor, curato salva, and simple telekinesis.</p><p>The Pillar of Knowledge involved the academics. While studying this pillar, students spent much of their time in the Jedi Archives learning about the galaxy, stars, and planets, the various flora and fauna known to the Jedi, and the history of the Order itself. Finally, the last pillar, Self-Discipline involved lightsaber combat and meditation. Here, Initiates were taught the various forms of meditation such as Empty meditation and Rising meditation, and the first form of lightsaber combat, Shii-Cho. Once ready, the Initiates underwent a series of exams that analyzed their progress and determined if they were ready to advance into the next rank.</p><p>If the Initiates passed, they would proceed to the rank of Padawan. As a Padawan, the Jedi would be assigned to a Knight or Master who would guide them through this stage. It is at this stage that the Jedi would construct their very own lightsaber. The process included deep periods of meditation, collection of various components, and, of course, the achievement of a lightsaber crystal. The Jedi Padawan would continue to be formally instructed in the ways of the Force, training in the rest of the lightsaber forms, mastering more advanced Force techniques, studying the galaxy and its inhabitants in more depth, and learning more about the ways of the Jedi, but the main goal of a Padawan is to successfully complete the Jedi Trials.</p><p>The Jedi Trials consist of five distinct trials: the trials of Skill, Courage, Spirit, the Flesh, and Insight. The Trial of Skill requires the Padawan to display an adequate sense of expertise, control, and discipline, whether that be through a lightsaber duel against a formidable opponent or other means. The Trial of Courage places the student in a position that necessitates bravery and maturity. An example of this would be the confrontation of a Sith Lord, as was the case with <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> when he faced and defeated <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/darth-maul/4005-5406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5406\">Darth Maul</a>. The Trial of Spirit involves a Padawan's ability to purify oneself of dark side emotions and resist the temptation of the dark side entirely.</p><p>The Trial of the Flesh, often times considered the most difficult of the trials, tests the Padawan's pain tolerance. This pain could be mental or physical, but it must be significant. Lastly, the Trial of Insight demands the student showcase great wisdom, whether that be through finding a solution to a difficult problem without the use of violence or displaying ability to avoid expert deception. There is no particular order in which the trials must be tackled, but once they are all passed, a Padawan will be Knighted.</p><p>No longer bound to a master, a Jedi Knight was free solve problems their own way. As an official Jedi of the Order, their duty was to uphold the principles of the Jedi throughout the galaxy. To do so, a Knight would undertake specific jobs that would employ their greatest talents. Examples of jobs would be Jedi Starfighters or Aces, Jedi Seers, or Jedi Shadows.</p><p>To attain the rank of Master, a Knight must successfully guide a Jedi Padawan to the rank of Knight and show great mastery over most aspects of the Force. The legendary rank of Grand Master was incredibly rare, often times only being held by a single Jedi at a time. To achieve this rank, a Jedi must be unanimously considered the Master of Masters, the Wisest of the Wise, and the most powerful Jedi in the Order. It is the highest possible honor within the Jedi Order.</p><h4>Jedi Ranks</h4><p>As previously described, the ranking system is as follows:</p><ul><li>Jedi Initiate</li><li>Jedi Padawan</li><li>Jedi Knight</li><li>Jedi Master</li><li>Jedi Grand Master</li></ul><p>A Jedi Knight may also choose to specialize in one of the three branches of Jedi: the Jedi Guardian, Jedi Consular, and Jedi Sentinel.</p><p>The Jedi Guardian was a vigilant crusader against evil of all shapes and sizes. Guardians were known for focusing much of their attention on lightsaber combat, mastering every form with deadly efficiency. Typical jobs for a Jedi Guardian included peacekeeping, security, military, and martial instruction.</p><p>Jedi Consulars served as diplomats, scientists, teachers, and healers. Their duty in the Order was to uphold the central values of the Order and spread the doctrine of the Jedi. They were known for their mastery over the Force, while usually obstaining from direct physical combat when possible.</p><p>The rarest of the three classes, Jedi Sentinels were appropriately viewed as a balance between the Consular and Guardian. Sentinels didn't prioritize Force knowledge over martial prowess or vice versa. They instead devoted much of their attention towards the non-Force related skills and traits. As such, Sentinels served as the Order's computer specialists, mechanics, security experts, and masters of espionage.</p><p>They would often be sent to remote regions of the galaxy to infiltrate enemy ranks, safeguard specific territories, or gather intelligence on unknown areas. Most Jedi that survived Order 66 were thought to be Jedi Sentinels.</p><h4>The Jedi Code</h4><p>The Jedi Code speaks of serenity and peace.</p><p><b>There is no emotion; there is peace.</b></p><p><b>There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.</b></p><p><b>There is no passion; there is serenity.</b></p><p><b>There is no chaos; there is harmony. (Added in <em>Star Wars: KOTOR</em>)</b></p><p><b>There is no death; there is the Force.</b></p><p>There was a new Jedi Code after the fall of the Empire.</p><p><b>Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.</b></p><p><b>Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.</b></p><p><b>Jedi respect all life, in any form.</b></p><p><b>Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.</b></p><p><b>Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.</b></p><h2>Other Sects</h2><h3>Gray Jedi</h3><p>Not all Jedi that leave the Order turn to the dark side. Those that can retain their self-control and discipline become Gray Jedi. A rare breed of Force users, they often turn to a life of solitude, as former Jedi find it very difficult to integrate into \"normal\" life. A few practicing Jedi have been considered Gray Jedi by some, as was the case with Qui-Gon Jinn. Although very unusual, Sith who reject the teachings of their masters may also become Gray Jedi.</p><p>Force users who were never trained in the ways of the Jedi or Sith but still used the Force could be considered Gray Jedi as well, an example of this being members of the Jensaarai. The term was also used to describe simply those that walked the lines between the light side and the dark side. As such, Force users like Revan who utilized both the dark side and the light side of the Force were sometimes considered Gray Jedi.</p><p>Around 130ABY, Imperial Knights who served under Emperor Roan Fel were referred as Gray Jedi.</p><h3>Dark Jedi</h3><p>Many users of the dark side of the Force aren't members of the Sith Order and as such are labeled Dark Jedi. These Force users are often times ex-Jedi who left the Order but were rejected by the Sith. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/asajj-ventress/4005-46932/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46932\">Asajj Ventress</a> was an example of this, being first trained in the ways of the Jedi but eventually falling to the dark side and being rejected by the Sith.</p><p>Some, however, never cared to join the Sith such as the infamous Dark Jedi <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jerec/4005-51828/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51828\">Jerec</a>, a former respected Jedi Master who turned to the dark side after Order 66. Many organizations that utilized and worshiped the dark side but were not affiliated with the Sith were classified as Dark Jedi such as the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nightsisters/4060-56758/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56758\">Nightsisters</a>.</p><p>It is believed that the first ever Dark Jedi who is credited among others with the creation of the Sith Order was Xendor, a former Jedi.</p><h2>Order 66</h2><p>Order 66 was a directive given to the <a href=\"/clone-trooper/4005-47004/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47004\">Clone Trooper</a> Army directly from Chancellor Palpatine. The directive had been secretly put in place at some point during the creation of the Clone Army and could be considered the whole reason for the creation of the Clone Army in the first place.</p><p>The exact working of the order is unknown but its purpose was to designate the <a href=\"/jedi/4015-52199/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\">Jedi</a>, once the ally of the Clone Troopers, an immediate threat and to be killed on sight. Many Jedi were individually assigned to brigades of Clone Troopers to command them in assaults and defense and so were already spread out too thin. The order was communicated directly through the internal headsets of every Clone Trooper and was carried out without question.</p><p>Many Jedi were cut down within moments of the order's activation, being caught off guard and out numbered at close range. Some, like <a href=\"/aayla-secura/4005-5389/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5389\">Aayla Secura</a> and <a href=\"/plo-koon/4005-5403/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5403\">Plo Koon</a>,never saw the coming threat and were killed instantly. Others, like <a href=\"/ki-adi-mundi/4005-5422/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5422\">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a>,were able to sense the threat from their own troops and were able to defend themselves for a time before being overwhelmed. <a href=\"/yoda/4005-5396/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\">Yoda</a> was one of the Jedi who took down his attackers before they could act.</p><h3>Great Jedi Purge</h3><p>This started the Great Jedi Purge and the near extinction of the Jedi as a force for good in the galaxy. The disorganized Jedi were now split apart and with Anakin's raid on the <a href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\">Jedi Temple</a>, they had nowhere to return to. Those that remained tended towards anonymity, exile, and contemplation. Darth Vader spent a great deal of time and resources hunting down the remaining Jedi both personally and via other means.</p>",

When two superhero teams meet up (either being in the same comic universe or not) will needless fight each other, either over a misunderstanding of one another or a trivial dispute, mostly over morals. In some cases, many team members even fight amongst themselves for no real good reason.</p><p>*<b>Death has hardly any real power in comics</b>: No matter how long or how brutal a character's death, they can brought back to life by either faking their deaths, magic, time-travel, and even broken reality. A good example how the Titan Traitor, Bombshell, got he throat cut open on panel but still mange to come back to life.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-250572\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5875\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-250572\"><img alt=\"Its just a flesh wound\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Its just a flesh wound\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/8190/250572-195348-batman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Its just a flesh wound</figcaption></figure><p>*<b>Just a Flesh Wound.</b> : No matter how fatally injured a main or popular character gets in an issue, with the exception of special events, the character would not only stay alive while others would have died, they are able to walk off the injury shortly after receiving it and be complete over it issues later.</p><h2>Cliche Stories</h2><p>In the field of comics, all the companies tend to reuse the same kind of stories again and again, each different but also the same in their own way.</p><p><b>Mad with Power</b>: This is the most cliche story plot is usually when a hero character achieves God-like powers, usually after some disaster or twist of fate happens to him/her in their personal life, and goes mad and goes on a rampage on the planet;leaving the hero's friends having a hard time by choosing either saving their friend from him/herself or just kill him/her.

      "description": "<h2>What You Need To Know</h2><p>A secondary mutation is when a mutant develops a new mutation/new power. This mutation could do various things, from giving a new power to returning an old power or building on an old mutation.</p><h2>Examples</h2><p><a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> - When <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a> was attacked by <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/4005-11317/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11317\">Cassandra Nova</a>'s <a href=\"/sentinel/4005-8299/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8299\">Sentinel</a>s, and they killed most of the mutants living there, Emma Frost's second mutation saved her life. Her new power is the ability to turn her body into near-indestructable diamond, but this power blocks her telepathy.</p><p><a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/4005-4568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4568\">Black Tom Cassidy</a> - Gained the power of clorokinesis (he turned into and was able to control all plant life). He lost this power when <a href=\"/m-day/4015-41003/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-41003\">M-Day</a> struck.</p><p><a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> - Iceman's secondary mutation was directly linked to his first: his body was completely turned to ice, and he wasn't able to change back and forth between human and ice form. In this form, if he was destroyed he was basically immortal because he was able to reform himself from water. He lost this power due to M-Day.</p><p><a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> - Beast has some sort of secondary mutation, that seems to keep evolving. His beast form evolves into something new.</p><p><a href=\"/angel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> - Angel recently developed the power to heal others with his blood, providing they're the same blood-type. He may have always had this mutation but didn't realize it, because <a href=\"/icarus/4005-9739/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9739\">Icarus</a>, a mutant with similar powers, had healing powers that derived from his wings.</p><p><a href=\"/warpath/4005-2158/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2158\">Warpath</a> - Warpath developed the power of self-propelled flight, although for some reason it has never been stated officially that this was a second mutation. This hasn't been exhibited in a while, but he did display some sort of ability to either jump far or fly again recently.</p><p><a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Polaris</a> - After her powers were drained by her alleged half-sister, <a href=\"/zaladane/4005-21948/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21948\">Zaladane</a>, Polaris developed the ability of super-strength, but she generated negative emotions while doing this. Her powers were later returned and this secondary mutation disappeared.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Film</h3><h4><a href=\"/x-men-days-of-future-past/4025-1549/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1549\">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></h4><p>In the film, <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a> is shown to have developed additional abilities during the 17 years since <a href=\"/x-men-the-last-stand/4025-24/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-24\"><em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em></a>. While Kitty could initially phase herself and other through solid objects, she is now shown able to send the minds of people back in time into their younger bodies, essentially allowing time travel. This ability proves crucial in stopping the <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a> from wiping out the entire mutant race.</p><p>Additionally, Best is implied to have undergone a secondary mutation in the 10 years since <a href=\"/x-men-first-class/4025-1048/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-1048\"><em>X-Men: First Class</em></a>. He now sports a more ape-like appearance that looks almost nothing like his previous, cat-like form from the first prequel.</p>",
