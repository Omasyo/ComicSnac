Garth, <a href=\"../../light-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ayla</a>, and their older brother <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mekt</a> were joy riding when their ship lost power and came down on the world of <a href=\"/korbal/4020-56256/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56256\">Korbal</a>. They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy. After their return with new found powers, Mekt disappeared. Garth left home to look for his brother.

When his sister arrived to join the Legion as Winath's official representative, Garth quit in shame. He went on to work for the industrialist <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/4005-12846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12846\">Leland McCauley</a> on his <a href=\"/workforce/4060-47189/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce</a> team. Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/4005-21136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21136\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place.

They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4466257668712\" data-width=\"815\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later.

Garth assisted Legionnaires past and present in hunting down <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mordru</a> to save Cosmic Boy. <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zero Hour</a> then happened and Garth and the other Legionnaires sacrificed themselves to save the timestream and create a new reality.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>The Death of Garth</h4><p>When half the Legion was stuck in the 20th century, Brande personally asked Garth to become Legion leader. Live Wire wasn't comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl's manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship. Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth's Body Restored</h4><p>Garth's spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Element Lad</a>'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad's body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow \">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3312693498452\" data-width=\"646\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 646px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-506307\"><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Powers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 646w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/506307-sensor26.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Silver Age: Lightning Man</h3><p>In the original debut of the Legion of Supervillians, this team came from a time when the Legion of Superheroes had reach adulthood.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/4005-10006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10006\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one.

Before Querl, his <a href=\"../../brainiac-4/29-69693/\" rel=\"nofollow \">mother</a>, a famous scientist for Colu, held the title. She abandoned Querl on his day of birth and he inherited her research. He was speaking by the time he was an infant and functionally working as a scientist by a toddler. Querl's research conflicted with Colu's and he was sent to do research for <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow \">R.J. Brande</a>. Querl destroyed several of Brande's labs, and when Brande could no longer afford to keep him on staff, Brande sent him to work at the Time Institute on Talus. While there, he met Rond Vidar. Querl received a draft notice from Colu to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. He was so wrapped up in his work, that he ignored it. Once he was noticed as missing, he was brought into the Legion.</p><p>Joining the Legion as Brainiac 5, he was instrumental in many cases. He saved the Earth from the White Triangle, healed Triad, cured Andromeda's lead poisoning, and created the anti-gravity metal that was used in the Legion Flight Rings. He developed a crush on Andromeda, but after she was seemingly killed, he threw himself into his work. He made some new discoveries, and used them to travel back in time to save the hero, <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Valor</a>. He was arrested by the United Planets, however, because time travel was illegal. He was pardoned when R.J. Brande became President and legalized time travel. Brainy and a group of Legionnaires were exiled to the 20th Century by the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Emerald Eye</a>. With his technological sources limited, the Legionnaires were trapped for several months.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure style=\"width: 353px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959816\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1699716713881\" data-width=\"353\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:117.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959816\"><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-width=\"353\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg 353w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/959816-brainiac_44.jpg 353w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px\" data-width=\"353\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>On Earth-Prime, Brainiac 5 is an influential figure with leadership designs that include usurping leadership of the United Planets. Early on Brainiac 5 comes into conflict with Legion leader <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cosmic Boy</a> about the way he has been leading the team. Brainiac 5 is visited by <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lemnos</a> and is the only Legionnaire to later recall his face. Brainiac 5 broadcasts a conversation between Cosmic Boy and <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sun Boy</a>, causing a fight between the Legionnaires on his side and Cosmic Boy's supporters. Cosmic Boy is called back to his home planet and Brainiac 5 assumes leadership of the Legion. They reconciled later and moved forward as allies. <a href=\"../../dream-girl/29-1254/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dream Girl</a> was killed during a Terra Firma attack and Brainiac 5 recovered her body and became obsessed with finding a way to resurrect her. He captured Lemnos to try and revive her, but the experiment destroyed her physical body. It did however leave her consciousness alive in Brainiac 5's dreams.</p><p>Later, Brainy's intellect turned the tide in the battle with the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dominators</a>. Brainy constructed a \"bomb\" , which was really a <a href=\"../../phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Phantom Zone projector</a>, which <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mon-el</a> flew into the core of the Dominion Homeworld. He also created an anti-lead serum for Mon-El. Brainiac 5 invented a Chronexus that could view the past, and even open temporary time travel portals. With the help of <a href=\"../../evolvo-lad/29-12854/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Evolvo Lad</a>, he used the Chronexus to send <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Supergirl</a> back to the 21st Century. After Cosmic Boy's disappearance, he manipulated events that resulted in the arrest of <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mekt Ranzz</a>, boosting <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Timber Wolf's</a> powers, and the recruitment of possible Legionnaire <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow \">E.R.G. 1</a>. Still, his ultimate goal was to bring Dream Girl back to life. Brainiac 5 spent more and more time sleeping to be with her. After a time, he proposed in the dream realm. After inventing a machine that could upload the Legionnaires' minds into an information-based reality and being forced to recreate their bodies, he created a body for Dream Girl as well, downloading her consciousness from his mind into the new body. He then invited the Legion to attend their wedding.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure style=\"width: 647px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541904\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3910355486862\" data-width=\"647\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-541904\"><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg 647w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg 647w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" data-width=\"690\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p>The event known as <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes has returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team prior to the Five Year Later. Due to the removal of the original Supergirl and the <a href=\"../../retcon/12-43566/\" rel=\"nofollow \">retcon</a> addition of the latest Kara Zor-El, Brainiac 5's past was changed. He joined the Legion as before, but without Supergirl accompanying him. Brainiac 5 would later meet the current Kara Zor-El when she was stranded weeks later in the future. He was against the idea of letting her stay. She spent an extended period of time with the team, most notably when Satan Girl attacked Earth. The two teamed up to defeat her, sparking a young romance, before Kara returned home. During this period, Brainiac 5 intentionally rigged the founding Legionnaires' time bubble to visit Superboy rather than Superman. This resulted in Superboy's historic joining of the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><p>Rejoining the Legion after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Magic Wars</a>, Brainy used his knowledge to help protect the galaxy once more by organizing several secret missions among the Legionnaires to help protect time. He sent a team back to the 21st Century with lightning rods to retrieve the essence of <a href=\"/\">Bart Allen</a> after his death as a secret weapon for the future. He also had arranged for <a href=\"/\">Starman</a>, Thom Kallor, to place <a href=\"/\">Superboy's</a> (Kon-El) body in the Kryptonian chrysalis in the 21st Century to be resurrected in the 31st.</p><p>Later, <a href=\"/\">Earth Man</a> caused a wave of xenophobia to spread on Earth. Brainy sent a Time Bubble to retrieve Superman for assistance. Deported due to his heritage, Brainy took over leadership of Colu to deter the <a href=\"/\">United Planets</a> from going to war with Earth. Superman finally arrived in the 31st Century months later, and helped defeat Earth Man's Justice League. When <a href=\"/\">Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a href=\"/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage, Brainiac Five was used his previous contingencies of Superboy and Kid Flash to help turn the tide. He also recruited the Legion of Earth-247 and Earth-Prime to help. The Legionnaires eventually defeated the villains, though Earth-Man was forced by the government to join the Legion. Brainy made a special flight ring to keep Earth-Man under control but eventually awarded him a standard one. Presently, Brainiac 5 is investigating the mysterious <a href=\"../../harmonia-li/29-71175/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Harmonia Li</a>, a self proclaimed student of time travel and immortal.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>A insane Brainiac 5</h4><p>The computer tyrants of Colu, in the humanoid form known as <a href=\"../../pulsar-stargrave/29-52496/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Pulsar Stargrave</a>, claimed to be his real father, and caused Brainy to go mad for a time. Stargrave used Brainy to frame <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ultra Boy</a> for the murder of An Ryd, but this was cleared up when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chameleon Boy</a> discovered that Stargrave was the true culprit. Still mad, Brainiac 5 accidentally created the vastly powerful <a href=\"../../infinite-man/29-51353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Man</a>. Then he used the <a href=\"../../miracle-machine/18-56136/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Miracle Machine</a> to create the unstoppable Omega, which destroyed <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes-headquarters/34-55774/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Headquarters</a>.</p><p><a href=\"../../matter-eater-lad/29-3598/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Matter-Eater Lad</a> saved the day, but it drove him crazy as well.

When <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Glorith</a> defeated the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Time Trapper</a> and took his place in history, one of the biggest side-effects was that Supergirl was erased from the Legion's history and replaced with <a href=\"../../andromeda/29-6965/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Laurel Gand</a>. Laurel stayed on with the Legion continuously, unlike Supergirl, and she and Brainy enjoyed a lengthy and healthy romance when they were young. However, he began to neglect her because he could not justify ignoring his responsibilities for romantic pursuits. In this new history, after the conspiracy to defeat <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Glorith</a> and his subsequent expulsion from the Legion, he left Earth for Colu without consulting Laurel and their relationship ended.</p><h4>Zero Hour</h4><p>Brainiac 5 traveled to Winath to help try to find a cure for the <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Validus</a> plague. He then rejoined the Legion when they reformed after facing <a href=\"../../roxxas/29-21133/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Roxxas</a> the Butcher. Although both he and Laurel had rejoined, he felt uncomfortable around her, because she had found love with Brainy's best friend, Rond Vidar. An incident with Glorith left Brainiac 5's body aged, causing him to have to wear a special suit to allow mobility. He later went into hiding with the team when they were framed for aiding the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Khunds</a>.

Once out of the anomaly, Brainy found himself changed. His personality was more friendly and there were grafts on his face that controlled his force field. <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gates</a> jokingly renamed him Brainiac 5.1, a name that stuck for a short time. After an attack on Earth by the Blight, Brainy was one of ten Legionnaires who were lost in a rift in space. After a year in the \"Second Galaxy\", Brainy was able to use <a href=\"../../shikari/29-5941/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shikari's</a> pathfinding abilities to lead them home. Once home, they were soon threatened by Robotica, a collective of artificial intelligence. Brainiac 5 learned that this collective was engineered by Computo, whom he had created while in the 20th century. Computo had survived through the ages and considered itself to be Brainy's progeny. Later, Brainiac 5 and the other Legionnaires barely survived the destruction of Earth-247 during the <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a>. They were brought to New Earth by that Earth's Brainiac 5. After the Legions of Three Worlds defeated Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainy and the other Legionnaires from Earth-247 chose to explore the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow \">multiverse</a> as the \"New Wanderers\".</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intellect</h3><figure style=\"width: 180px\" data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1711621\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.91111111111111\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:91.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1711621\"><img alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg 180w\"><noscript><img alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/63864/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"></noscript></a><figcaption>12th Level Intelligence</figcaption></figure><p>While the population of 20th century Earth has a 6th level intelligence, and average <a href=\"../../coluans/65-55891/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Coluans</a> have a 10th level intelligence, Brainiac 5 has a 12th level intelligence. Hence, Brainiac 5 is known as the smartest person in the universe.</p><p>He is able to create very advanced technology such as time machines (such as the Time Cube, Time Spheres and Chronexus), Flight Rings, artificial intelligences, and Force Shields. Brainy is also knowledgeable with medical technology as well, having invented the anti-lead serum for Mon-El and curing Matter-Eater Lad of his madness. Each level of intelligence represents a separate thought track, allowing him to think about or solve twelve equations simultaneously. His brain processes formulas at the speed of a computer.</p><p>While physical combat is not something he excels at, he has been known to use his body physics in combat to defend himself or incapacitate opponents. His advanced intellect presents a challenge when people try to affect him with mental abilities - he just thinks faster than they do. He has been known to learn new languages in just hours of listening to conversation.While it is not often illustrated, he excels at using technology in all forms (he is one of the Legion's best pilots), or finding weak spots in other people technology. With his powerful mind he can regulate his body's automatic nervous features with ease.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Brainiac 5 has several other equipment items at his disposal. Brainiac's personal force field belt is nearly impenetrable when it is active. One version of his force field belt is used by <a href=\"../../booster-gold/29-1786/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Booster Gold</a>. In some iterations, like the Brainiac 5 of Earth-247, this force field is actually internalized. As a Legionnaire, he is equipped with a Legion flight ring which allows him to fly. It can also be used as a long-range communication and tracking device.</p><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Brainiac 5 possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower.

This abilities replaced Brainy's force field belt in this universe. This Brainiac 5 was one of the Legionnaires to travel to the past to recruit a young Superman, the start of Brainy's lengthy admiration of the Boy of Steel.

He brings Superman back onto the team and ultimately reveals to Kal-el his connection to the villainous Brainiac, causing a rift between the two friends. Determined to not become like his ancestor, Brainy accessed a part of his programming that was from the original Brainiac in order to increase his own knowledge. This backfired as it allowed Brainiac to slowly corrupt Brainiac 5, ultimately turning him into his host for his return. The entire Legion assembled and it was Superman who helped free Brainiac 5 from his ancestor's control. The resulting purge of Brainiac's programming converted Brainiac 5 into a human being for the first time. Ashamed of his actions and wishing to learn about his new found humanity, Brainy left the Legion in the serie's finale.</p><p><b>Smallville</b></p><p>In the episode entitled \"Legion,\" the Legion founders travel to the past to defeat Brainiac.

As a result, young Lyle was predominantly raised by the Foccart family. A child prodigy, Lyle became interested in chemistry at an early age thanks to the Foccarts. Initially, he only created and patented things like new flavors of ice cream, but soon became more complex with his creations. His greatest invention was a serum that bent light around his body and clothing, rendering him invisible at will. EarthGov became interested in Lyle's discovery and enlisted him to do some investigative work for them. He was joined by the powerless Jacques Foccart, whom Lyle considered a brother, and the young woman who would one day become the villainous <a href=\"/charma/4005-52495/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52495\">Charma</a>. Lyle's knowledge of the <a href=\"/durlans/4060-42477/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42477\">Durlan</a> language and close friendship with <a href=\"/\">Chameleon</a> suggests that he spent time on <a href=\"/durla/4020-57515/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57515\">Durla</a> during these days. On his last mission, Lyle was tricked into stealing his own formula. Jacques consumed it, but unlike Lyle he appeared to simply fade from existence. Disgusted, Lyle quit EarthGov and was instead drafted by Earth into the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure style=\"width: 283px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608517\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2932862190813\" data-width=\"283\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608517\"><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg 283w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608517-invisiblekid1.jpg 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" data-width=\"283\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Lyle was a child prodigy in this reality who was asked by his father and the government to create an invisibility serum. Upon learning that his father had planned to give it away for military use, Lyle decided to inject himself with the only sample so that it could never fall upon abusive hands. He lied about injecting himself, claiming instead the serum never worked. Lyle then contacted his colleague, <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a> of the Legion of Super-Heroes, for help in escaping from his parents who had registered him on public service. Lyle and Brainy had previously collaborated on the Legion flight rings. Brainy sponsored Lyle for Legion membership and he was accepted as Invisible Kid.

He developed feelings for time-lost member <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Supergirl</a>, who didn't reciprocate and ultimately left the team. On a mission to Triton, Lyle developed feelings for a local girl named <a href=\"../../gazelle/29-50438/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Giselle</a> who had been ridiculed by her people, but was afraid to show himself to her. To investigate matters that didn't fall under the Legion's proper jurisdiction, Lyle formed the top-secret Legion Espionage Squad and served as its leader. Eventually, Giselle joined the Legion as Gazelle. Lyle, still hiding from his crush, used virtual reality to make himself appear older and buffer than he truly was. Gazelle was fond of this form, but when Lyle's ruse was uncovered she didn't seem to mind the real Lyle either.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Invisibility</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Invisible Kid developed and consumed a serum that allowed him to turn any or all parts of his body invisible at will.

Dirk was hit in the head during a press event and suffered amnesia just as Dr. Regulus returned to seek revenge. Dirk regained his memories in time to defeat his rival, doing so again years later when he returned after Dirk's 11 solar year (17-18 years) birthday party.

Dreamy joined the Legion under false pretenses and ultimately resigned, but Thom still had feelings for her.

He lured Thom into a trap and would have killed him had Star Boy not shot and killed Kenz in self defense.

During that time, he was nursed with some exotic whale that sped up his recovery but also granted him Kryptonian-like powers which he discovered upon properly joining the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-170012\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.6352941176471\" data-width=\"255\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 255px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:163.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-170012\"><img alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg 255w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy.jpg 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px\" data-width=\"255\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Boy (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>The Star Boy of Earth Prime differed from other realities in that he was of African descent. His origin otherwise was never specified to be any different. He was still from the planet Xanthu. Thom was a member of the Legion again and a big supporter and defendant of initial leader Cosmic Boy. Dream Girl had expressed interest in him before her death, though it was never stated Thom reciprocated. He sided with Cosmic Boy when the Legion stood divided between Cos and Brainiac 5 but pulled together with the rest of his team to defeat Terra Firma. He traveled to <a href=\"/winath/4020-56915/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56915\">Winath</a> months later to search for the missing Cosmic Boy and instead found <a href=\"/lightning-lord/4005-3592/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3592\">Lightning Lord</a>, who was charged with the war crimes previously placed on Cos. Wielding the power of gravity like Thom did made him instrumental to several of the Legion's later victories, especially when guided by Brainiac 5's precise calculations. He was often paired with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Light Lass</a> for the most dynamic results.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1480/84466-13043-starman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-84466\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1480/84466-13043-starman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-84466\"><img alt=\"Starman (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Starman (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Starman (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored an analogue of the original Legion to continuity. Following the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/4045-56080/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56080\">Magic Wars</a>, Star Boy rejoined the team and was one of several Legionnaires who assisted <a href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\">Brainiac 5</a> on a covert mission to the 21st century. While traveling through time, Star Boy became unhinged and came to reside on Earth-22, the <a href=\"/kingdom-come/4045-41641/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41641\">Kingdom Come</a> reality. He later used his powers on his costume again to travel to New Earth proper. Shortly upon arriving, Thom discovered that the ancient medicine of that era wasn't enough to keep his schizophrenia in check and he had to cope with his mental illness. This made him lucid enough that he forgot his initial mission, instead taking on the name \"Danny Blaine\" from a Xanthu pulp hero and deciding to defend <a href=\"/opal-city/4020-47880/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-47880\">Opal City</a> like the <a href=\"/starman/4050-5259/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5259\">Starmen</a> before him. He even took on their codename.</p><p>Homeless, he was quickly taken in by Opal's Sunshine Sanitarium to help with his mental confusion. It was there he fell in love with sloppy joes. Shortly thereafter, his heroic efforts in Opal caught the attention of the reformed <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/4060-27589/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-27589\">Justice Society of America</a> and Thom was recruited.  He left the JSA after participating in the Lightning Saga crosover then digging up the body of Connor Kent.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth</h3><h4>Star Boy x Dream Girl</h4><p>Upon his expulsion, Thom was met by Dream Girl and recruited into the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The pair later left the Subs and donned suits of armor to hide their identities as they joined the Legion as <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Supergirl</a>'s replacements, per their request. Following Thom's adventure as Sir Prize, the Legion elected to bring Star Boy and Dream Girl back onto the team despite their past actions. Star Boy served on the Legion for many years and continued his relationship with Dream Girl, even during a strained part of their relationship years later when Dream Girl was elected Legion leader. She eventually offered Thom the job of her deputy leader so they could spend more time together, which he only begrudgingly accepted because her term was almost over. On a mission to Xanthu and following a rough patch with Dreamy, Thom was commanded by his people's government to serve as their new planetary champion. Star Boy accepted the position and resigned from the Legion to care for his homeworld. He warded off <a href=\"../../atmos/29-28222/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Atmos</a> in battle several times to keep the title, though he lost Dream Girl to the other hero.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><p>Star Boy rejoined the Legion following the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Magic Wars</a> but only served for a short time. With the Legion falling on dark times, Thom returned to Xanthu. He fell in love with and later married Yvyya, the owner of the Naltorian Dreamers batball team. Thom retired from heroics and became their coach, though he did come out of retirement during <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zero Hour</a>. With his timeline collapsing, Star Boy joined his past teammates in helping to rescue <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cosmic Boy</a> and ultimately sacrificed himself to reboot the universe.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Star Boy in the 21st century</h4><p>As a Legionnaire, Star Boy was inducted with the draft dodging <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gates</a> and was often scrutinized by <a href=\"../../colossal-boy/29-1271/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Leviathan</a>, who felt responsible for the death of Thom's predecessor and refused to let Thom end up like Kid Quantum. Star Boy helped assemble the Fatal Five and was one of many Legionnaires spared being trapped in the 20th century. When the Legion held open auditions for the first time, Star Boy was on the judging panel and it was there he met his future girlfriend, Dreamer. Thom was smitten with her and they began to date shortly thereafter. He returned to Xanthu several times to both cement his position in the Legion and to help ward off an invasion. He was distraught when Xanthu ceded from the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow \">United Planets</a> to the Allied Planets and refused a call to return home with the other Xanthian Legionnaires. One visit to Xanthu also led him to team up with <a href=\"../../jack-knight/29-23783/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jack Knight</a>, a time-lost hero named Starman. Thom then learned of his destiny to one day be the Starman of the 21st century.</p><h4>Robotica Invaded</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-891602\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.88888888888889\" data-width=\"1656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-891602\"><img alt=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 1656w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 1656w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/28079/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01_.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Boy vs Robotica</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, Thom's Kryptonian superpowers began to haywire. Due to his liability in the field, Star Boy was sidelined. These powers ultimately faded and Thom returned to active duty in time to be captured during the Blight Invasion. He was later freed but elected to leave the Legion when Dreamer began having nightmares. They traveled to Xanthu and worked with the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Khunds</a> to fine-tune both Dreamer and Thom's powers. Instead of just inducing mass, Star Boy learned how to decrease it as well. When Robotica invaded Xanthu, Star Boy ultimately stayed behind with former teammate <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow \">XS</a> when the planet was evacuated. They were saved from their exile weeks later by a reformed Legion, which Thom rejoined and later Dreamer joined as well. Thom was spared from the destruction of Earth-247 because the Legion had been lost in the timestream on an adventure.

Freeing Nura, Thom was reminded of his original mission in the past. He rejoined with the other Legionnaires and they successfully used lightning rods to gather the essence of the deceased <a href=\"../../bart-allen/29-1680/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bart Allen</a>. When the other Legionnaires returned home, Thom remained in the past with the Justice Society to aid Brainiac 5 in one other contingency. Thom took a job as a grave digger and dug up the body of <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Conner Kent</a> and took it to a rejuvenation chamber in the <a href=\"../../fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Fortress of Solitude</a> which would resurrect the hero over the span of a 1,000 years.

Gog even restored Thom's sanity for a time. Already in the 21st century, he became a de facto member of the Legion on a mission in the past to carry out <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow \">R.J. Brande</a>'s Last Will and Testament, protecting the bottled cities Brainiac had stolen. With his last mission in the past finally complete, Starman was presumed to return to the future.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Gravity Control</h3><p>Star Boy possesses the ability to control the gravitational force of an object. He does so by borrowing the gravity from stars and redirecting this force onto a designated area. He can sink cities and pinpoint it to objects smaller than pebbles. He is capable of drawing enough mass to create a black hole by recreating the weight of a collapsing star. Thom wears a suit crafted together by three different Brainiac 5's that is a map of the multiverse. It is fine tuned so that Thom's mass induction ability when properly applied can create small wormholes into these realities or transport himself. It is a skill he has yet to refine.</p><h3>Kryptonian</h3><p>Previously, after crashing through a comet tail, he gained the powers of a Kryptonian as well as the ability to breathe fire. In the postboot, he also gained electrical vision. In both iterations, these abilities were only temporary.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759269\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5625\" data-width=\"448\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 448px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759269\"><img alt=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" data-width=\"448\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg 448w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759269-starboy.jpg 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" data-width=\"448\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Star Boy (Batch SW6)</figcaption></figure><p>Zero Hour created a blip which added a young Star Boy to the SW6, time-displaced <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legionnaires</a> team.

Jan has always been one of the most powerful members of the Legion, yet one of the most withdrawn. His mental discipline, which guarded him from accidentally killing people with a stray thought, allowed few people to get close to him. This changed when he met <a data-ref-id=\"4060-23409\" href=\"/science-police/4060-23409/\">the Science Police</a> liaison to the Legion, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6967\" href=\"/shvaughn-erin/4005-6967/\">Shvaughn Erin</a>. Their relationship grew at a pivotal time in Jan's Legion career. After serving as the team's deputy leader, he was appointed to the post by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\" href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a>, who resigned. He was angered to lose the ensuing election to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1254\" href=\"/dream-girl/4005-1254/\">Dream Girl</a>, (coming in second for the <em>fourth</em> time) but bounced back after that to win two full terms for himself. Jan and Shvaughn made a good team. They worked together to investigate suspicious things surrounding the Legionnaire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-50657\" href=\"/chameleon-girl/4005-50657/\">Shrinking Violet</a> and eventually uncovered the fact that she'd been replace by a <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4624\" href=\"/durlan/4005-4624/\">Durlan</a> spy.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1562498\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 361px\" data-ratio=\"1.8919667590028\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:189.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1562498\"><img alt=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px\" data-width=\"361\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png 361w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/1562498-elementlad02.png 361w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 361px) 100vw, 361px\" data-width=\"361\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alchemist (Earth-247)</figcaption></figure><p>Young Jan’s eagerness to help actually saves his life. Once again, Roxxas the butcher leads a band of his merry men to wipe out Trom, but this time there are a few differences. This version of Roxxas is a rabid xenophobe, who believes that his people are superior to all other races, and are perfectly justified in destroying their lives and cultures to protect their uniqueness. Another important catch: Roxxas comes from <a data-ref-id=\"4020-42416\" href=\"/daxam/4020-42416/\">Daxam</a>, and he and his posse have the full powers of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-21508\" href=\"/mon-el/4005-21508/\">Mon-El</a>.

His power included transmutation of elements through touch, although the transmuted objects would revert back to their original chemical compositions after a minute. Jan's reasons for joining the Legion were that he saw them as a nexus of great change, something all Trommites would have appreciated. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\" href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\">Chameleon</a> mentioned that Element Lad was the sole survivor of his planet, Trom, although that was never elaborated on.</p><p>Some of the Legionnaires, Element Lad included, aided Brainiac 5 in his resurrection attempt on Dream Girl, although Jan was personally against the idea. The attempt seemed to have failed when Dream Girl's body disappeared, and Element Lad unsuccessfully tried to convince Brainiac to let her go. This version of Jan Arrah has been shown to be greatly fascinated of change, and also displayed a strong dislike for physical violence.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407548\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 519px\" data-ratio=\"0.9402697495183\" data-width=\"519\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407548\"><img alt=\"Element Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 519w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Element Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 519w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58294/1407548-26.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Element Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p>The events of <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities.

It is revealed that Shvaughn had been born as a male named Sean, and had taken a futuristic sex-change drug called ProFem in order to secure Element Lad's love. With ProFem no longer available in the tough economical times, Shvaughn reverts back to Sean; Jan is unfazed, saying <em>\"Look, it doesn't matter. Don't you understand ... ? Anything we ever shared physically ... it was in spite of the ProFem, not because of it ... !\"</em> Whether Jan is gay or bisexual in the New 52 reality is yet to be revealed.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Jan Transmuted Himself</h4><p>Element Lad continued to explore the limits of his abilities, even successfully transmuting <i>himself</i>. He discovered this somewhat by accident with the sorcerer Mordru turned him to crystal. Though his awareness was expanded, he found it more difficult to change other objects unless he first changed himself to a similar substance. The transformation made Jan's mind somewhat unstable for a while.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><p>Following the Blight's attack on Earth, Element Lad was one of ten Legionnaires who disappeared into a rift in space. The rift transported them into a void. He was the first to awake and transformed himself into Tromium crystal in order to survive. He gathered up the Legionnaires and sheathed them in Tromium as well, which had the effect of time-stasis.</p><h4>Enter Progenitor</h4><p>Recording his thoughts in memory crystals, he calculated a way to move the Outpost back to ordinary space. He was successful, but the Legion re-entered space in another galaxy, far from home. Jan himself entered the same galaxy, but billions of years in its past, while the universe was in its infancy. The Tromium made him immortal, and he drifted for billions of years, completely alone, watching stars and planets come into being. When planets began to bear life, he used his powers to accelerate their evolution. His tinkering gave rise to many races, including the Progeny and the Kwai. He eventually became known as the Progenitor and created for himself a home world called the Rosette. By this point, there was very little of the boy who was Jan Arrah. The Progenitor acted like a god, ordering the Progeny to \"delete\" any life forms which he considered \"variants.\" Eventually his timeline caught up to that of his fellow Legionnaires. They had been fighting the Progeny and finally met the aliens' master. Jan barely remembered them.</p><h4>The Death of Progenitor</h4><p>When he learned that they intended to return to their home galaxy, the Progenitor hatched a plan to follow them. He intended to remake that galaxy, too. He told the Legionnaires that he also intended to destroy all life in this Second Galaxy before he left. Of course, his former teammates could not allow either of these things. When they opposed the Progenitor, he killed <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12837\" href=\"/monstress/4005-12837/\">Monstress</a>. To defeat him, the Legion managed to release the Omniphagos, a being that the Progenitor intended to use to erase all life. It took all the Progenitor's powers to subdue the creature. Meantime, the Legionnaires made it through a space warp home. They lost another one of their number, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\" href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\">Live Wire</a>, who sacrificed himself to overload the Omniphagos with electricity.</p><h4>Live Wire is Element Lad</h4><p>Back home, Element Lad was memorialized on Trom with the memory crystals that remained from the Second Galaxy. In time, something miraculous happened—Live Wire emerged from the crystals, his mind imprinted on the former crystalline body of Element Lad! With the help of the Brainiac 5 of Earth-0, Live Wire eventually recovered enough to change his own form back to normal.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>The Death of Element Lad</h4><p>Like every active Legionnaire of his world and Earth-247, Element Lad was transported to the 31st century New Earth, to help the present Legion combat <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40756\" href=\"/superman-prime/4005-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\" href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/4060-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a>. When <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1259\" href=\"/sun-boy/4005-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> was murdered by Superboy-Prime on New Earth, Element Lad decided to put his qualms about violence aside to avenge his friend. He managed, notably enough, to create Kryptonite that Superboy-Prime showed to be vulnerable against (he had earlier been immune to the radioactive substance, due to Kryptonians only being affected by Kryptonite from their respective universes). In his rampage, Prime responded by launching one of the Kryptonite rocks through Element Lad's torso, killing him. A while after Prime was defeated, Brainiac 5 of New Earth explained that the reason Prime was vulnerable to Jan's Kryptonite, was that Element Lad and his Legion were from the reality of Earth-Prime themselves.</p><p>During the events of Legion of Three Worlds, the Element Lad native to the New Earth universe (supposedly the same as the original, pre-Crisis version of him) had been reported as missing. The Legion had not heard from him since the start of <a data-ref-id=\"4045-55650\" href=\"/superman-and-the-legion-of-superheroes/4045-55650/\">Earth-Man's xenophobic campaign</a>.</p><h4>Black Lantern Element Lad</h4><p>Element Lad was one of many people who Superboy-Prime had killed, he travel from the future to Earth-Prime to kill Prime.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Transmute</h3><p>Element Lad have the ability to transmute substances on the atomic level. This a native ability to their home world, Trom. The Element Lad of Earth-Prime's transformations only lasted 60 seconds, and he had to be in contact with the material.</p><h3>Divine Powers</h3><p>The Element Lad of Earth-247 he had also learned how to change his own chemical make-up. As the Progenitor, he lived over billions of years, in the Second Galaxy. In this time, he learned to use his abilities to actually create (or destroy) life, making him near-omnipotent.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Element Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>.

At the battle of Venado Bay, Cosmic Boy was caught in an explosion that cost him his magnetic powers and left him disoriented. He stumbled into an Imsk camp thinking it was a Braalian one and would have been killed if not for <a href=\"../../shrinking-violet/29-12835/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shrinking Violet</a> stopping her troops. The disoriented Rokk, realizing now where he was, lashed out at Vi and left her scarred over one eye. He was never aware that it was Vi he had done that too until years later.

The SW6 Cosmic Boy was one of few Legionnaires to notice when the \"crisis in time\" took hold. He, Saturn Girl and Live Wire traveled into the past to investigate their origins and wound up fighting alongside the 20th century's heroes during that \"Zero Hour.\" They returned to the 30th century believing they had stopped the menace, but soon learned that they must reemerge with their older counterparts in order to repair the time stream.

As the team's first leader, Cosmic Boy often had to appease the United Planets while also spreading their movement to gather more Legionnaire fans and supporters. Several Legionnaires became loyal to Cos' hardwork while others began to be persuaded by <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brainiac 5</a>, who thought he could do a better job. Eventually, the two sides came to blows until the leaders came to an agreement. Cos' homeworld of Braal was about to undergo quarantine and ordered all natives to return within 24 hours.

At some point, Cos ended his relationship with Night Girl so that he could concentrate solely on the Legion and take care of the team so others, like the married Ranzzes, wouldn't have to worry. Cos, as leader, continued to deal with politics following Earth's bout of xenophobia and the Titanian refugees after Titan was destroyed. The pressure reminded Cos how much he disliked the politics of being Legion leader and he posted a call for a new leader election.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Earth 0</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187669\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55238095238095\" data-width=\"1260\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1260px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2187669\"><img alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 1260w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 1260w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/99801/2187669-ac_18.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cosmic Man (Earth 0)</figcaption></figure><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"../../flashpoint/39-56280/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Flashpoint</a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Lighting Lad (Now Lightning Man) and Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"../../anti-superman-army/65-58873/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anti-Superman army</a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Silver Age:</h3><h4><b>The Great Darkness Saga</b></h4><p>Cosmic Boy leads a squad of Legionnaires consisting of <a href=\"/wildfire/4005-3621/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3621\">Wildfire</a>, <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superboy</a>, <a href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Phantom Girl</a> and the newest <a href=\"/jacques-foccart/4005-26646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26646\">Invisible Kid</a>. Once they arrive their attacked by their shadowy foes who continues talking about the coming darkness while casually battling the assembled squad before retreating with the wand. Cosmic Boy then gathers his squad and races to London to prevent the ancient sword Excalibur from being stolen but Cosmic Boy alongside Phantom Girl and Superboy are sent flying as Invisible Kid and Wildfire fail to prevent the newest shadow minion's escape with the sword. The squad then scrambles to prevent the theft of an ancient orb, but they fail but manage to capture one of \"The Masters\" shadow servants. Following several missions by three teams of Legionnaires Cosmic Boy calls to the worried Saturn Girl, but is attacked mid-call causing Saturn Girl to rush to his aid to find the captured servant to be the attacker.After a short battle however the two are defeated and only saved by Lightning Lad's arrival knocking out the monster.</p><p>Cosmic Boy alongside Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad are the Legionnaires to discover the identities of three of the shadow servants being <a href=\"/darkstar/4005-47236/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47236\">Lydea Mallor</a>, Superman and a Guardian of the Universe. Learning this prompts Cosmic Boy to send out a general alert to all Legionnaires. Cosmic Boy then takes part in the battle against the <a href=\"/daxamites/4060-42480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42480\">Daxamites</a> under the control of <a href=\"/darkseid/4005-2349/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2349\">Darkseid</a>, being part of the team to distract him as <a href=\"/element-lad/4005-1263/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1263\">Element Lad</a> added lead into the atmosphere to activate their vulnerability. He later joins his teammates in an effort to capture the weakened Darkseid, but they fail as he flees. However following Darkseid's defeat he suffers another loss as a terrorist detonates a bomb in the city doing much damage, including to Cosmic Boy's home forcing his entire family to be hospitalized and leading to the death of his mother.</p><h4>Legionnaires 3</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was visiting the now newly retired Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl and his god son Graym. It just happened to be the weekend in which the Legion's greatest foe attacked kidnapping <a href=\"/graym-ranzz/4005-52820/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52820\">Graym</a> and delivering the challenge that only the three Legionnaires can battle him this time or he the child dies. Cosmic Boy then prepares to aid in the rescue of his godson visiting Metropolis University to request a leave of absence from coaching the Mangaball team. The three then head to Legion ally, <a href=\"/rond-vidar/4005-12860/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12860\">Rond Vidar</a> explaining the situation in confidence to gain a time machine but refuses prompting Saturn Girl to incapacitate him. Cosmic Boy then uses a distorter to assume the appearance of Rond leading them to a time cube as an officer attempts to stop them forcing Cosmic Boy to use his powers on him as he alongside his two friends activate the time cube.</p><p>The three then arrive at the the end of time, with the Time Trapper personally allowing a gap in the time barrier so the three can enter. The three then begin to battle the Trapper's minions in their efforts to kill the Legionnaires,but are captured by the surprise his minions are human bombs which releases nerve gas knocking them out and bringing them to his stronghold.Lightning Lad is then separated as Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy escape battling Trapper's minions through out the citadel and gaining his aide Otok as a guide. He leads the two to Graym as they realize that he is well taken care of that Lightning Lad has been the true target. However the hour glass runs out before the Time Trapper can break Lightning Lad's sanity, as a result he sends all of them home to a point just shortly after they left.</p><h3>Five Years Later:</h3><h4>The New Time Trapper</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was the easy choice when the team reformed to lead again. Even though he was powerless, the other Legionnaires looked to him. Cosmic Boy and the Legion helped free Earth from the Dominators and saved Earth's populace when the planet exploded. A younger counterpart of Cosmic Boy, as well as the Legion from their early years, were discovered and went on to become the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legionnaires</a> of <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow \">New Earth</a>. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brainiac 5</a> eventually created gauntlets for Cosmic Boy that would replicate his powers; however they slowly modified his personality and drove him mad. Shrinking Violet stepped in as leader. Going by Polestar now, he left the team to single-handedly rebuild Earth. He was subdued, but then captured by <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mordru</a> during the Legion's last hours before <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Zero Hour</a>. The whole Legion, past and present, rallied to save Rokk. and he managed to escape, but was lost in a library where time past differently. For hundreds of years, he lived in this library and studied the art of time manipulation. He ended up becoming the Legion's oldest foe, the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Time Trapper</a>. The Time Trapper freed his past self just as reality was coming to an end. Cosmic Boy merged with his SW6 counterpart, alongside the other Legion founders, as the last beings in the universe in order to reset time.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247:</h3><h4>Trapped In The 20th Century</h4><p>While Legionnaires like <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow \">XS</a> harbored a crush on Cosmic Boy, his eyes were set on Saturn Girl despite her fondness for Live Wire. She was his heart's desire and after an explosion left he and Imra stranded in the 20th century, the two began a romance much to the ire of Garth's sister, <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spark</a>. he enjoyed spending time with the heroes of legend he had grown up with during the team's exile. Cosmic Boy was left mentally comatose after Imra's mind was attacked by Dr. Psycho while he was linked, though he was ultimately revived by Saturn Girl's heightened powers. Unfortunately, she had just been subconsciously manipulating his body. Once she realized this, he was revived properly and in shame Imra ended their relationship and admitted she still had feelings for Garth. He hid his hurt and resolved to reunite Garth and Imra, which he did when their team returned to the 30th century.</p><h4>The New Wanderers</h4><p>Following the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Blight</a> invasion of Earth and half the team being thought for dead, the Legion was disbanded. Cosmic Boy secretly served R.J. Brande as a mercenary Legionnaire while Brande prepared Legion World and the reformation of a new Legion. When the Legionnaires thought lost returned and the team reformed, Cos became defacto leader. He helped end <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s reign as secret president of the United Planets before calling for a new leader. Impressed by <a href=\"../../kid-quantum/29-1520/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kid Quantum II</a> during the Ra's battle, he nominated her as his replacement and the Legion voted her in. After the incident, the two began a flirtation that became a romance. When <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Superboy</a> was a member of the team, Cos rode him hard because he felt Kon wasn't living up to the legacy of Superman. Eventually, Earth-247 was destroyed and Cos and his Legionnaires were spared because they were lost in the timestream. After assisting two other Legions in defeating <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Superboy-Prime</a>, he and Kid Quantum led their Legion into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow \">multiverse</a> to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime:</h3><h4>Cosmic Boy Leaves The Team</h4><p>When <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Supergirl</a> joined the team, he was instrumental in helping her realize she wasn't dreaming and the two had a brief romance. Cosmic Boy was captured and tortured by <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dominators</a>, but it was all part of a plan to trick them into going to a wrong location. Cosmic Boy's last and most controversial move as leader was ordering the dying Mon-El to take a bomb to the heart of the Dominator planet and destroy it. In actuality, the bomb was a phantom zone projector that locked the Dominators away from Earth. Cos kept this a secret from even his close friends to prevent anyone freeing them. Sending a noble hero to his \"death\" as well as exterminating an entire race was poorly received by the Legionnaires and the public alike. A public leader election for the Legion was called and Supergirl replaced him. A trio of heroes from the Knights Tempus of the 41st century then appeared to Cosmic Boy. They told him that he was regarded in history as one of the greatest heroes ever and they invited him to join their team. Cos accepted and left the Legion. He never returned, though his war crimes were eventually pinned on <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lightning Lord</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Magnetism</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005970\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.98093220338983\" data-width=\"472\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 472px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005970\"><img alt=\"Magnetic Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" data-width=\"472\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg 472w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Magnetic Powers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83063/2005970-cos15.jpg 472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" data-width=\"472\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Magnetic Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Cosmic Boy's superpower is super-magnetism. He can manipulate, repel or attract metal objects of varying sizes. Naturally, the more metal is in an object the easier it is for him to affect magnetically. Cosmic Boy has been shown to pull large iron meteors and satellites down from space with minimal effort. He can use his magnetic power on rocks that contain iron ore to pull or use them as projectiles. He can also magnetize metal objects so that they become magnets themselves and  make them stick to other metal objects. His power cannot affect non-magnetic metals, such as aluminum and gold, or organic substances like wood or flesh. His control is such that he <em>can</em> manipulate electronic records or the iron in blood. He has been known to use a uniform with ferrous fibers so he can fly with his own powers, but usually relies on a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion flight ring</a>.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><h4>Legion Flight Ring</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608228\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.57190635451505\" data-width=\"299\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 299px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-608228\"><img alt=\"Fight Ring\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg 299w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fight Ring\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/608228-legionflightring.jpg 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fight Ring</figcaption></figure><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Cosmic Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>.

Once Yera was discovered by the Legion, Micro Lad was once again defeated and this time imprisoned in a sens-tank.</p><p>Micro Lad somehow escaped though, and joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/4060-47190/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47190\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> on many of their failed missions before being killed by his fellow Legionnaire <a href=\"/akka/4005-77100/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-77100\">Akka</a>.</p><h2>Reboot: Earth-247</h2><p>It's Legion Membership Drive Time! Some Legionnaires go to Imsk to recruit a new member from their world. Three Imskians, including Shrinking Violet, compete for the Legion membership. In the course of the competition, another Imskian competitor, Ion is mysteriously killed. In the course of the Legion's investigation, they and Violet determine that the third competitor, Micro, is the killer.</p><p>Violet and the Legionnaires expose Micro and his crime to the other Imskians, at which Micro attempts to escape by shrinking out of sight. But while this tactic works well enough against Phantom Girl and Spark, it's much less effective when you're on an entire planet full of beings who can do the exactsame thing, especially when one of them is the aforementioned Violet.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Size Manipulation</h3><p>As with all natives of the planet of Imsk, Micro Lad has the ability to shrink to drastically smaller proportions. He can easily shrink all the way down to microscopic size, and can even achieve sub-atomic size when necessary. He employs his shrinking ability in a variety of effective ways, though the most common is that of stealth as it renders him very difficult to detect by enemies. For this reason she became a founding member of the Legion Espionage Squad.</p><h2>Attributes</h2><p><b>Marital Status:</b> single</p><p><b>Known Relatives:</b> none</p><p><b>Group affiliation:</b> Heroes of Lallor</p><p><b>Base Of Operations:</b> 30th century</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6‘2” <b>Weight:</b> 200 lbs <b>Age: </b>In his twenties</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue <b>Hair:</b> brown</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Micro Lad is a petite, fit, and muscular athletic man with red curly hair, and has green eyes.

When he flew his space cruiser into a space whale, he was trapped for weeks. The only way for Jo to survive was to eat the meat of the beast, which gave Jo super-powers and allowed him to escape. Once free, Jo decided to try to become a hero. He was enlisted by an Earthman by the name of <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/4005-12846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12846\">Leland McCauley</a> to become a member of his <a href=\"/workforce/4060-47189/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-47189\">Workforce</a>, rivals to the Legion. Despite this status, Ultra Boy became fascinated with Legion member <a href=\"/phantom-girl/4005-1257/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1257\">Apparition</a>. After recruiting <a href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\">Live Wire</a> for the Workforce, Jo and Tinya began to date to the disdain of her mother, <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/4005-12817/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12817\">Winema</a>. During a battle against the White Triangle, Apparition was incinerated in Ultra Boy's invulnerable arms. In mourning, Jo quit the Workforce and aided the Legion covertly before becoming a Legionnaire himself. Days into his Legion membership, Ultra Boy became ill and began having hallucinations. He discovered that Apparition's spirit had survived, tethered to Ultra Boy. She was only visible to Jo and Winema Wazzo, causing other Legionnaires to think Ultra Boy strange and speaking to himself.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-169232\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5282392026578\" data-width=\"301\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 301px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-169232\"><img alt=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" data-width=\"301\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg 301w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy.jpg 301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px\" data-width=\"301\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>On Earth-Prime, Ultra Boy was once more a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes which was now a youth rights movement.

He formerly had a relationship with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/4005-30997/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\">Light Lass</a> and tried to sleep with <a href=\"/duplicate-girl/4005-1262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1262\">Triplicate Girl</a> until he found out he was being strung along for information.

While on the run, the Legion also travel to Rimbor, where they are captured by Jo in his new guise as the Emerald Dragon and freed by him to help defeat several gangs. A reunion with Mon-el has the Daxamite recall that he worked in the 20th century with a hero named <a href=\"../../phase/29-12983/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Phase</a> who reminded him of Phantom Girl.

Though her intangibility put a strain on their relationship at times, Ultra Boy still loved her and to cement this fact the two were married in a secret ceremony in the past. After merging with Phase, Apparition was restored to physicality and the Ultra lovebirds returned to the 30th century. They were separated twice thereafter, once when Apparition was off-world and Ultra Boy was possessed during the Blight Invasion and again when Ultra Boy is lost in another galaxy with a team of Legionnaires. Ultra Boy initially believed Apparition was lost with him, but he and the Legion soon learned that Tinya was merely a telepathic illusion made by <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Saturn Girl</a> to keep the powerful Ultra Boy in-line. During a confrontation on the matter, the despondent Ultra Boy kissed Saturn Girl as he felt a familiar connection after weeks of her roleplaying Jo's wife.</p><h4>Ultra Boy's meets his baby son Cub</h4><p>Upon his return to his own galaxy after a year lost in space, Ultra Boy assisted the Legionnaires in reforming the team and taking down the corrupt government of <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ra's Al Ghul</a>. He was reunited weeks later with Apparition, finding that she now had an infant - Ultra Boy's son, named Cub. During their time apart, Tinya had been watched over by <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Timber Wolf</a> and Wolf's closeness to Jo's family left the two at odds with each other. Jo's son was also rapidly aging, though this matter was never resolved before Infinite Crisis wiped Earth-247 away. While his son didn't survive, the Legion did as they were lost in the timestream.

During this adventure, a connection was made between Jo and Saturn Girl, whose boyfriend was neglecting her at the time. When he later confronted her about it, the two had a brief moment of intimacy psychically. Before anything physical could happen, they were interrupted by <a href=\"../../invisible-kid/29-1256/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Invisible Kid</a> and Saturn Girl rejected Ultra Boy's further advances.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Ultra Powers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1736839\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"2.0355555555556\" data-width=\"225\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 225px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:203.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1736839\"><img alt=\"Ultra Powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg 225w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultra Powers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/82665/1736839-169223_47994_ultra_boy_super.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" data-width=\"225\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultra Powers</figcaption></figure><p>Ultra Boy can utilize the energy in his body in a variety of ways, but only one at a time.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Lemnos was born at some point in the 30th century, somewhere in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56731\" href=\"/united-planets/4060-56731/\" slug=\"united-planets\"> United Planets</a>. A psionic handicap he had would make his brain emit a quantum frequency that changes other individuals' chemicals and electrons related to memory. Hence, he could be in a crowd and be recorded by any electronic device, and after leaving, any memory or trace of him ever being there (or even existing for that matter) would disappear just within a few minutes. He claimed to <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\" href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" slug=\"brainiac-5\"> Brainiac 5</a> the at he had to stay within his parents' line of sight so they wouldn't forget to feed him.<br/> <br/> As it is next to impossible to remain completely undetected from everything in the 30th/31st centuries, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-23409\" href=\"/science-police/4060-23409/\" slug=\"science-police\"> Science Police</a> found enough traces of to track him down and capture him. They were desperate to find out how he had been able to stay hidden for so long, but unluckily enough for them, had already gained control over his ability. Such control that what used to be a handicap was now what could be called a superpower. With this, could easily manipulate the memories of anyone or anything, meaning he could trick an interrogator to believe he was alone in the interrogation room, for instance.<br/> <br/> Rather than allowing himself to become some sort of lab rat for the Science Police, used his ability to spy on them, gathering as much valuable information as possible. Below their [the Science Police] noses, he was able to work behind the scenes to build his own technoempire. He figured that a man with his ability could anything without taking the responsibility or consequences for it...and hence become incredibly rich (stated by Brainiac 5 as being rumored to be the wealthiest individual in the known universe) and also shape every governmental decision to match his agenda.<br/> <br/> Lemnos has one thing in common with the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\" href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" slug=\"legion-of-super-heroes\"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a> - they both believe that the United Planets is a too slow and dull society for its own good. Which is why he supports the Legion in secret and has manipulated the outcome of numerous government decisions to help their cause. But for Lemnos, the peaceful \"rebellion\" of the Legion wasn't enough. He would take stronger actions to \"help\" the United Planets...even if it meant shocking them out of dormancy by declaring war. War was something could start by manipulating the outcast of the galaxy...the children of exiled criminals, leaved for dead by the UP. They became his army, and they were lead by some of the most powerful beings among them, called <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47457\" href=\"/terra-firma/4060-47457/\" slug=\"terra-firma\"> Terra Firma</a>.</p> <p> Lemnos's plan would have worked perfectly if it had not been for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1254\" href=\"/dream-girl/4005-1254/\" slug=\"dream-girl\"> Dream Girl</a>, who, during a precognitive vision, predicted that Lemnos (although his name was not known at the time) would have a connection to upcoming wars. Brainiac 5 was able to extract the image from her mind and upload it to his computer systems, although on a search, he couldn’t find any information whatsoever about him.</p> <p> Praetor Lemnos’s first target in the United Planets was planet  Orando, the economic centre. Lemnos’s armies were successful in destroying the planet and its inhabitants, leaving only <a data-ref-id=\"4005-6797\" href=\"/projectra/4005-6797/\" slug=\"projectra\"> Princess Projectra</a>, who was on Earth at the time. Not long after, when Brainaic 5 was still trying to figure out who the mysterious warstarter was, Lemnos himself walked into Brainiac’s lab and introduced himself, and told about his origins and agenda. Including telling him that the next target was planet Colu, Brainiac’s homeworld. Brainiac refused to cooperate with him, leading Lemnos to walk out and erase Brainiac’s memories about their meeting. Brainiac though, had already sent a digital message to himself saying “COLU IS NEXT”, that he received a while later (leading him, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5945\" href=\"/chameleon-boy/4005-5945/\" slug=\"chameleon-boy\"> Chameleon</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\" href=\"/saturn-girl/4005-1273/\" slug=\"saturn-girl\"> Saturn Girl</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30997\" href=\"/light-lass/4005-30997/\" slug=\"light-lass\"> Light Lass</a> to go to  Colu).</p> <p> On planet Colu, Lemnos had already devastated the planet – but not the same way as Orando, by military force. On Colu, he had instead forced complete amnesia upon the population, rendering the scientific centre of the United Planet useless. Even though it was too late for the Legion to save Colu, Light Lass noticed that Chameleon’s antennae (which only appears when he is scanning a new lifeform) appeared for no apparent reason. She figured someone not visible was around them, and she destroyed the area by creating a massive anti-gravity field, forcing Lemnos to reveal his existence if he was to survive. escaped, but not before Brainiac 5 regained his memories and Saturn Girl seeing him (hence being able to shield every Legionnaire from memory manipulation).</p> <p> <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1274\" href=\"/elysion/4005-1274/\" slug=\"elysion\"> Elysion</a>, one of the members of Terra Firma, was captured by the Legion after a battle on planet Helegyn. Thanks to him, Saturn Girl could find out where Lemnos’s base world was, and hence the Legion set an investigation team to go there.</p> <p> After a long battle (with reinforcements from the rest of the Legion), Lemnos’s armies along with Terra Firma were defeated. would have escaped if it hadn’t been for Brainiac 5, who opened a portal and stunned him with a seemingly powerful weapon. Lemnos is currently held in stasis by Brainiac 5.</p>",

Retiring from his superhero career, he became known as The Sensei. Residing in the 31st century in the Japanese sector of a united Earth, The Sensei trained Val Armorr in all Martial Arts techniques as well as peaceful creative practices such as meditation, sculpting, and painting. Val became a master of all martial arts forms taught to him, many having their origins on different worlds. He left his Sensei in search of new forms of fighting to master. In his travels he developed his own style known as Super-Karate. When Val returned to Earth, he found that the Legion of Super-Heroes was in need of new recruits to help fight a creature of great power known as <a href=\"/sun-eater/4005-47363/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47363\">Sun Eater</a>.

He was alone though, because one of <a href=\"../../duplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Triplicate Girl</a>'s bodies, calling herself \"Una,\" stayed with him. The two visit <a href=\"../../barbara-gordon/29-5368/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Barbara Gordon</a>, where it was revealed that Val was dying.

Upon arriving at Orr's compound Karate Kid briefly battled <a href=\"../../equus/29-46916/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Equus</a>, until Orr arrived on the scene and told them that Karate Kid's illness was similar to the <a href=\"../../omac/29-31217/\" rel=\"nofollow \">OMAC</a> virus. Under the order of <a href=\"../../desaad/29-4681/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Desaad</a> (a lackey of <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Darkseid</a>), Orr told them to visit <a href=\"../../buddy-blank/29-48221/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Buddy Blank</a> in Colorado. Equus and a misunderstanding with the cops and <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Supergirl</a> delayed the trip. Val then met Buddy Blank and his grandson, who took them to see Brother Eye. The entity scanned Val, informing him that he was infected by the \"Morticoccus\" virus, and directed the group to what was once <a href=\"../../bludhaven/34-55771/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Blüdhaven</a>. Brother Eye had detected a similar strain there. In Blüdhaven, the group encountered the <a href=\"../../atomic-knights/65-55772/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Atomic Knights</a> and <a href=\"../../firestorm/29-2353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Firestorm</a>. When Val's sickness reaches a breaking point, Brother Eye freed itself, and traveled to Blüdhaven, and turned it into its new base, and used the Atomic Knights and Firestorm as power sources. He was later transported to <a href=\"../../apokolips/34-41470/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Apokolips</a>, as Brother Eye intended to assimilate the Morticoccus during Apokolips' assimilation. As the attempts failed, Brother Eye was forced to assimilate Una instead, having her carry Val inside himself for <a href=\"../../anti-vivisectionists/65-56190/\" rel=\"nofollow \">vivisection</a>.</p><p>As Brother Eye was defeated, both Val and Una were freed, but Val was now grievously wounded, with Una pleading for his life as the other assembled heroes considered the idea of killing him before the virus spread. When the group arrived on another of the 52 Earths, Val is taken to <a href=\"../../project-cadmus/65-47233/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Project Cadmus</a> and died as <a href=\"../../dubbilex/29-12683/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dubbilex</a> examined him. During the autopsy, the Morticoccus was released, and spread its infection into the air. Because of assimilating Val's 31st-century blood, it was practically immune to any form of treatment.The bodies of Val and Una were eventually discovered by the <a href=\"../../gotham-city/34-23611/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gotham City</a> Police Department on New Earth, and Superman and the visiting Lightning Lad mourned their passing.

He also possesses the ability to sense the weakest spot in an object. His skill in hand-to-hand combat is seemingly superhuman, allowing him to simulate super-strength blows. His prowess was so high that he was able to take on Superboy when he auditioned for the Legion of Superheroes. Val Armorr is the youngest warrior ever to earn the title Samurai. The computer in <a href=\"../../fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/\" rel=\"nofollow \">the Fortress of Solitude</a> has him ranked as a class 15 whereas <a href=\"../../batman/29-1699/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Batman</a> is only ranked as a class 12.

The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower.

At one point, his mother was turned to glass and Gim was blackmailed into flubbing a mission, which earned him additional training in the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47210\" href=\"/legion-academy/4060-47210/\" slug=\"legion-academy\">Legion Academy</a> for a time until his mother was saved. Marte, Gim's mother, was eventually elected President of Earth and during her tenure she was notorious for supporting the Legion and allowing the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56731\" href=\"/united-planets/4060-56731/\" slug=\"united-planets\">United Planets</a> to assist them where they could.

Yera had been hired to infiltrate the Legion and it was she, not Shrinking Violet, who had fallen in love with Colossal Boy. Despite the deception, Yera had been duped into the infiltration and Gim quickly accepted the fact that it was Yera he had come to love so quickly, not Shrinking Violet.

He was still raised by Jewish parents and was childhood friends with Gigi. She was still present when he received his powers, this time from a meteor that crashed on Mars while Gim and Gigi were in pursuit of a criminal. Becoming a full fledged officer of the Science Police on Mars, Gim was actually reluctant unlike his previous counterpart to get pulled from S.P. duty to become Mars' official draftee into the new Legion of Super-Heroes as Leviathan. Due to his Science Police training, he was named Legion leader on his first day over founder Cosmic Boy. A \"yes man,\" Gim didn't argue even when he could sense the disdain the founding Legionnaires had for him.</p><p>On his first mission as both Legionnaire and leader, fellow draftee <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47877\" href=\"/james-cullen/4005-47877/\" slug=\"james-cullen\">Kid Quantum</a> was killed by the villain Tangleweb. This caused Gim to resign as both leader and Legionnaire in shame, though <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1264\" href=\"/cosmic-boy/4005-1264/\" slug=\"cosmic-boy\">Cosmic Boy</a> insisted he stay on the Legion, as well as hold a grudge against Tangleweb. He eventually apprehended the villain and served as Legion deputy leader for the team's first year. He had a crush on teammate <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12808\" href=\"/kinetix/4005-12808/\" slug=\"kinetix\">Kinetix</a>, much to the dismay of Shrinking Violet who in this reality had an unrequited crush on Gim. He was hard on fellow Legionnaire <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1260\" href=\"/star-boy/4005-1260/\" slug=\"star-boy\">Star Boy</a>, likely because he was <a data-ref-id=\"4020-56504\" href=\"/xanthu/4020-56504/\" slug=\"xanthu\">Xanthu</a>'s replacement for the deceased Kid Quantum who died on Gim's watch. During a battle with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-31020\" href=\"/dr-regulus/4005-31020/\" slug=\"dr-regulus\">Dr. Regulus</a> early in the Legion's second year, Leviathan uprooted a dangerous gas main and blasted it point blank at the villain to stop him. The ensuing radiation poisoning killed the villain, but Gim as well. He died telling Shrinking Violet that dying in the line of duty had always been his heart's desire. He was buried on Mars at a traditional Jewish service.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296685\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-296685\"><img alt=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)</figcaption></figure><p>In this reality, Gim Allon was from Earth but has different ancestry. He was born to a race of giants and had a genetic mutation which allowed him to shrink to a 6' height. This ability allowed Gim to interact with the average height Earthlings, whom he fell in love with, and where he learned of and eventually joined the Legionnaire movement. Gim took the codename Micro Lad due to his shrinking ability, though most Legionnaires called him Colossal Boy due to the fact it seemed to them that growing to his 'normal height' was actually the super power. Sometimes considered to be a little on the dim side, Colossal Boy was still a great friend and regarded highly by many Legionnaires.</p><p>He even allowed the Legion to stay at his giant-sized house for a time. He was romantically interested in Atom Girl, aka Shrinking Violet. His fondness for calling the Legionnaires \"little people\" was a cause of turmoil for his friendship with the size-conscious girl.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407491\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.55\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:255.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407491\"><img alt=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58294/1407491-colossal_boy.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Colossal Boy (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p>A close analogue to the pre-boot Legion of Super-Heroes was restored to continuity following <a data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\" href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" slug=\"infinite-crisis\">Infinite Crisis</a>.

Due to Earth Man's imprisoning of best friend Sun Boy and attacking his wife, Gim had reservations about Earth Man joining the Legion but eventually warmed up to him.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325135\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4225\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-325135\"><img alt=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gim (Five Years Later)</figcaption></figure><p>Gim's tenure with the Legion continued until the team was disbanded years later after <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Magic Wars</a>. Afterwards, Gim rejoined the Science Police and would eventually be promoted to Chief. He stayed with the Science Police even after the Legion reformed, though assisted them when needed.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Size Manipulation</h3><p>Gim Allon has the ability to enlarge his body proportionately, effectively growing to sizes from his normal height to heights of ten or twenty five feet, for example. The precise limitations on this power have not been established, nor the exact extent to which his strength increases with size, an apparent side effect of the growth. When Gim loses consciousness, he is returned to his normal size. In the threeboot continuity, Gim was actually from a race of giants and his ability was that he could <i>shrink</i> to a 6' height rather than the other way around. Gim's baseline height was never stated, but he could now only size-shift between these two dimensions instead of having an untold upper limit.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a Legionnaire, Gim has completed personal combat training and wears the Legion flight ring to fly. The ring also serves as a communication and projection tool. With his additional combat training from his studies with the Science Police, he is one of the most skilled hand-to-hand combatants in the LSH and familiar with law protocol.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-196786\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5551839464883\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-196786\"><img alt=\"Leviathan (Batch SW6)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg 299w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Leviathan (Batch SW6)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy.jpg 299w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px\" data-width=\"299\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Leviathan (Batch SW6)</figcaption></figure><p>Shortly thereafter, duplicates of the Legionnaires from their early days surfaced as part of a <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dominator</a> experiment, including one of Colossal Boy.

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><br/>Elysion was born sometime in the late 30th century, on an exile planet where the United Planets used to send their criminals. The population of the planet was left by the UP to die there, but that didn't go as expected. Most of the population, including Elysion, were superpowered, and this fit <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1268\" href=\"/lemnos/4005-1268/\" slug=\"lemnos\">Praetor Lemnos</a>'s agenda perfectly. Lemnos united the people and used them as an invasion army to direct at the United Planets, with a small group of the most powerful individuals, as the leaders and terraformers, the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-47457\" href=\"/terra-firma/4060-47457/\" slug=\"terra-firma\">Terra Firma</a>. Elysion became the Terra Firma's psychotic field leader.<br/><br/>Elysion, with his ability to telekinetically manipulate rocks and planetary matter, easily became one of the Lemnos's mosts dangerous soldiers. Going from planet to planet to terraform them, i.e. preparing them for invasion, the Terra Firma encountered <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1253\" href=\"/lightning-lad/4005-1253/\" slug=\"lightning-lad\">Lightning Lad</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1273\" href=\"/saturn-girl/4005-1273/\" slug=\"saturn-girl\">Saturn Girl</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"4060-19241\" href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/4060-19241/\" slug=\"legion-of-super-heroes\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, along with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-3619\" href=\"/timber-wolf/4005-3619/\" slug=\"timber-wolf\">Brin Londo</a>, on Rimworld 19. After an inevitable battle, where it looked like the Legionnaires had lost, Lightning Lad used an electrical attack on Elysion and his rock pillars to surprise them and win. Defeated, Elysion along with the rest of Terra Firma, returned to their homeworld.<br/><br/>Next time Terra Firma ran into the Legion, it was on planet Helegyn. Even though most Terra Firma members could escape, Elysion was tricked by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1261\" href=\"/shadow-lass/4005-1261/\" slug=\"shadow-lass\">Shadow Lass</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1263\" href=\"/element-lad/4005-1263/\" slug=\"element-lad\">Element Lad</a> to go to the dark and cold side of the planet, where he easily could be taken down. Brought to the Legion Headquarters, Elysion had powerdampers placed on him, and he was interrogated by Saturn Girl to find out where their base world was. Later, he was escorted by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1256\" href=\"/invisible-kid/4005-1256/\" slug=\"invisible-kid\">Invisible Kid</a> to one of the towers in the Legion HQ to be contained for the time being. However, when Lemnos awoke several sleeper agents, suicide attackers, on the Legion Plaza, one of them found his way into the tower and could free Elysion, leading Elysion to go on a destructive rampage through Metropolis. Only through the combined efforts of Invisible Kid, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1255\" href=\"/brainiac-5/4005-1255/\" slug=\"brainiac-5\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-12835\" href=\"/shrinking-violet/4005-12835/\" slug=\"shrinking-violet\">Atom Girl</a>, could he be stopped and imprisoned again. But not before the Legion Headquarters was destroyed by him and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1254\" href=\"/dream-girl/4005-1254/\" slug=\"dream-girl\">Dream Girl</a> being killed by the rubble.",

Bob Hardin was on the cable car with his friend who later came to use the moniker <a data-ref-id=\"4005-1286\" href=\"/grenade/4005-1286/\" slug=\"grenade\">Grenade</a>. They both joined the group of ultras known as <a data-ref-id=\"4060-40891\" href=\"/the-strangers/4060-40891/\" slug=\"the-strangers\">The Strangers</a>. Atom Bob was arguably one of the most powerful members, but his control over his power was tenuous at best . This later drove him to become the villain known as Pilgrim. <br/> <br/> <h2>Powers</h2> <br/>He had the ability to change things. Originally this was changing one object into another (sucha as baseballs to apples), but he later learned that he could also manipulate intangible things as well (love to hate, etc).",

He was among a small group of heroes of the 1940s called upon by the wizard Shazam to aid in his fight against his daughter Blaze and the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. Blaze was defeated and Shazam contained the Seven within ridiculous containment shells. Little was seen of Jack Weston as Minute Man after that, however, we know he survived the War as he appeared in Fawcett City. Well into his golden years, Jack, along with Jim Barr and <a href=\"/spy-smasher/4005-19155/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19155\">Alan Armstrong</a>, appeared on Whiz Radio to reiterate a battle with Captain Nazi towards the end of WWII.</p><p> </p><p>Jack was still involved in governmental affairs when Jim Barr sought him out to help clear his name. Old newsreel footage turned up implicating Bulletman conspiring with Nazis in sinking the Normandie ocean liner in . Jim was actually on a secret assignment in with the golden age <a href=\"/ted-knight/4005-9296/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9296\">Starman</a> when Normandie had sunk. Jim sought out Jack, who issued the assignment, in hopes he would be released from his oath of secrecy. This would enable him to reveal details of his secret mission in order to establish his alibi. Jack was supposedly shot by Neo-Nazi, thus preventing this from happening. However, Jim was cleared of charges despite this when the true saboteur, Laslo the Poser, stepped up and told the truth.</p><h3><b>Death </b></h3><p>Jack, along with his children and grandchildren, are killed their sleep by an unknown assassin at their home in Clearwater, Florida. As Minute Man, Jack was one of three patriotic superhero bloodlines (alongside of <a href=\"/mr-america/4005-31930/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31930\">Mr. America</a> and <a href=\"/general-glory/4005-2055/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2055\">General Glory</a>) wiped out by the efforts of <a href=\"/vandal-savage/4005-5722/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5722\">Vandal Savage</a> and the Fourth Reich. Savage was attempting to stop the regular occurrence of relatives assuming the patriotic identities of their loved ones.</p><p> </p><h2><b>Skills and Abilities</b></h2><p><span>With no super-abilities, Jack possessed the peak physical strength and endurance of a man of his age that participates in regular intense exercise. He’s a combat veteran with superb hand-to-hand combat skills with a vast knowledge of military weaponry. Jack is also a skilled tactician, strategist and well versed in espionage. His governmental connections provide him with certain degree of access to a variety of resources at his fingertips.</span></p><p> </p>",

Dan Richards had graduated at the bottom of his Police Academy class while his friend, Jim, had graduated with top honors. When Jim refused to kill for a corrupt politician, Jim was framed for murder. Richards became the <a href=\"/manhunter/4005-2529/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2529\">Manhunter</a> to prove Jim's innocence and capture the real killer. The Manhunter solved the case and captured the real murderer based on secret files he had gathered on known criminals. Richards continued being the Manhunter whenever the authorities were unable to solve mysteries or capture criminals.</p><p>The Manhunter had a dog as a partner named Thor, the <a href=\"/thunderdog/4005-75164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-75164\">Thunderdog</a>, that was always nearby when Richards walked his patrol as a policeman. Thor would join the Manhunter when he blew a supersonic whistle that was inaudible to human ears. Thor was an excellent tracker and attack dog. The Manhunter worked briefly with the <a href=\"/all-star-squadron/4060-41753/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41753\">All-Star Squadron</a> then later joined the <a href=\"/freedom-fighters/4060-40383/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40383\">Freedom Fighters</a>. The Manhunter met another costumed hero of the same name, <a href=\"/paul-kirk-ii/4005-63251/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-63251\">Paul Kirk</a>, when both were members of the All-Star Squadron. Both Manhunters later worked together with the <a href=\"/young-all-stars/4060-41754/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41754\">Young All-Stars</a>. The Manhunter continued his crime-fighting career at least into the 1950s. At some point, Richards retired from being the Manhunter.</p><p>Richards eventually learned about the ancient sect of <a href=\"/the-manhunters/4060-55857/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55857\">Manhunters</a> but not about their evil, murderous plans. Believing the Manhunters to be a force for good, Richards convinced his granddaughter, Marcie Cooper, to join them. During the <a href=\"/millennium/4045-40776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40776\">Millennium</a> event, Richards learned of the evil nature of the Manhunters when Marcie appeared as the <a href=\"/harlequin/4005-24282/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24282\">Harlequin</a> and attacked him and <a href=\"/molly-maynne-scott/4005-9309/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9309\">Molly Mayne Scott</a>. Richards and Molly Scott escaped from the Harlequin but Molly was injured in the process. Richards took Molly to a hospital where she recovered from her injuries.</p><p>Later, the Harlequin was defeated by <a href=\"/jade/4005-3406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3406\">Jade</a> and <a href=\"/obsidian/4005-9359/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9359\">Obsidian</a> assisted by Richards.

He was based on Berg Katse, a Gatchaman villain. However the two characters have significant differences. Berg was a high-ranking member of terrorist group Galactor, trying to take over the natural resources of Earth. He appeared to be a normal human but was the result of genetic engineering, fusing together two fraternal twins while in the womb of their mother. As a result Berg was born with both male and female components. His body switched genders numerous times in his life. The process was involuntary in his childhood and teenage years. He learned to control it in adulthood and used both his male and female form as part of a series of disguises. He believed himself to be a superior being. He committed suicide when he discovered his creator Sosai X, an alien, had only created him as a convenient tool and others viewed him as a freak of nature.</p><p>In the American adaptation, Zoltar was himself an alien from planet Spectra instead of a human. His planet was invading Earth and did not employ human operatives. His female-half was changed to be a separate character, his sister Mala Latroz. Latroz being an anagram of Zoltar.</p>",

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The character is one of literary origin and whose story has been told in comic book adaptations of the classic novel. The story of the Man in the Iron Mask is tied to that of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56948\" href=\"/the-three-musketeers/4060-56948/\" slug=\"the-three-musketeers\">the Three Musketeers</a>. With a corrupt king on the throne, the Three Musketeers plan to install a secret other member of the royalty on the throne in his place, in this case the king’s secret twin brother that has been hidden away since birth. Having been previously sworn to the service of the king the musketeers saw their actions of imprisoning the twin and guarding him behind an iron mask as deplorable yet they were bound by their service.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Man in the Iron Mask was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-60125\" href=\"/alexandre-dumas/4040-60125/\" slug=\"alexandre-dumas\">Alexandre Dumas</a>. In the early years of comics many different genres were often tried out in comics and one of these genres was to incorporate in illustrated versions of classic novels. The character first appearance was thus in <a data-ref-id=\"4000-165278\" href=\"/movie-comics-/4000-165278/\" slug=\"movie-comics-\">Movie Comics #5</a> in 1939.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>As the character is based around a single novel, which is primarily the only time his story is told, there is in fact little character evolution. However, in fact the character does mature somewhat through his ordeal, starting as a scared prisoner and evolving into the benevolent King of France.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>After his rescue the character is trained by the Three Musketeers to act as a kind would. Due to unforeseen circumstances they are forced to go ahead with their plan despite not being fully prepared. Eventually the king is replaced and the Man in the Iron Mask takes his place to rule peacefully over the land.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Man in the iron Mask is a regular man, though he shows a natural leadership ability as well as the ability to quickly adapt himself to the training of the Three Musketeers.</p>",

      "deck": "The Master of Kyokugenryu Karate, Ryo Sakazaki is the protagonist of Art of Fighting and one of the main characters of the King of Fighters, with both fighting game series belonging to SNK. He also shares a rivalry with Terry Bogard in the King of Fighters series.",
      "description": "<h3>Story</h3><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Ryo is <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47198\" href=\"/takuma-sakazaki/4005-47198/\" slug=\"takuma-sakazaki\">Takuma</a> and Ronnet's son and the older brother of Yuri. He started training in the martial arts at an early age, deeming to become Takuma's successor. Ryo was instilled by his father with the hard principle of self-reliance where one's strength can form their own worth in the world. He eventually got a sparring partner and friend in Robert Garcia when Robert was admitted into the dojo.</p><p>Ryo's mother died in a tragic car accident on Ryo's 10th birthday. Takuma left their home and left Ryo to take care of Yuri. In order to do so, he worked in construction and tirelessly strived to defend his family's dojo. He also started street fighting, remembering his father's words. He didn't do well at first, but after a lot of years of persistence, he eventually became a famous and feared fighter.</p><h2>Art of Fighting</h2><p>In the first game, Yuri gets kidnapped by Mr. Big, a local crime leader of the dangerous city, Southtown. During his journey on saving Yuri, he met a bouncer named King, who leads him and Robert to Mr. Big's location. With Robert and King's aids, Ryo confronts and defeats the kingpin. Chasing Mr. Big lead him to a karate dojo where a mysterious man in a tengu mask challenges him. When Ryo prevailed, he threatens to finish Mr. Karate if he doesn't give any information regarding Yuri's safety. Before he deals the final blow, Yuri reveals the man's identity as Takuma, their father. After eleven years of separation, the whole family is reunited.</p><p>Before the events of the second game, Ryo went into the mountains for training. He received an invitation to the King of Fighters tournament, which he accepted in order to test his strength. He was able to reach the finals and then the tournament's host, Geese Howard, wanted to hire Ryo into his services. Ryo refuses however and subsequently defeats him. Unfortunately, Geese manages to escape and later reenacts the beginning of the Fatal Fury story.</p><p>Ryo's role in the third game was reduced to being a supporting character for Robert. In his ending for the game, he hands over a ticket to Yuri for Robert's flight back home and wishes the best for both of them. He also gains another rival called Kasumi Todoh, who is later mentioned in The King of Fighters series.</p><p>It is assumed that after the Art of Fighting series ended, Takuma retired from fighting and entrusts the Kyokugenryu dojos to Ryo. At least two dojos are still active, one near Southtown and one is later entrusted to Ryo's student, Marco Rodriguez. This is supported by the fact that Ryo uses the Mr. Karate mantle that his father once held in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition and Buriki One.</p><h2>The King of Fighters</h2><p>The King of Fighters series was inspired by the fact that Ryo appeared in Fatal Fury Special as a secret final boss. Much of the appeal for the first game, KOF 94, was so that characters from both Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting can fight together and against one another. The story was retconned to make the characters from both FF and AOF appear around the same age, although KOF is separate from their respective series. Despite both protagonists having only support roles in the series, Ryo and Terry are friendly rivals. This is shown through special intros, official art and game openings.</p><p>Throughout KOF, The Kyoukugenryu is portrayed as a struggling family business, being funded by the prize money earned from KOF tournaments and Robert's vast wealth. Every year, after the conclusion of each KOF tournament, because of their strong performance, the Kyokugen dojo would have many applicants. However, because of the harsh training program or mysterious people who appear and trash the dojo, most of the applicants would quit, despite their hard fought success. The family is still running two dojos. One in South town and another in Mexico.</p><p>Ryo teams up with Robert, Yuri or Takuma to spread the fame of the Kyokugen style. He tries to keep his sister away from entering the KOF tournaments and gives in to his father's demands. He invited King to the team in KOF 2000, despite Robert's protests. Takuma observed (and sort of mistaken) the respect the young fighters had for one another and wants King to join the team whenever the time calls for it. In KOF XI, Ryo points out that his student, Marco is right now a green belt.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Ryo is both serious when it comes to fighting and loyal to his family and friends. Thanks to the martial arts training that he earned from his father, he has been given discipline. Although they're best friends, Ryo treats Robert as his rival. He is a little old fashioned and less intense, which separates him from his trendy sister, Yuri and his stylish rival, Robert. He admits to not being very intelligent and well talented, however, he believes that theses are the two obstacles for him to overcome. Ryo thinks he can achieve excellence in his art by hard work and experience compared to Yuri and Robert's training ideologies. Because he raised both himself and Yuri, he is struggling by his wish to protect his sister and his other wish to see her grow up. He accepts her growing maturity without being against it.</p><p>It is suggested that there is a romantic tension between Ryo and King. He suddenly thinks of her as a good friend, despite King thinking more of Ryo since he provided helping in her brother's recovery in AOF2. Their relationship is referred to many times throughout the KOF series.</p><h2>Profile</h2><p>Full name: Ryo Sakazaki</p><p>Birth date: August 2nd</p><p>Birthplace: <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55746\" href=\"/japan/4020-55746/\" slug=\"japan\">Japan</a></p><p>Height: 179 cm (5'10.5\")</p><p>Weight: 75 kg (165 lbs)</p><p>Blood type: O</p><p>Family/Relatives:</p><ul><li>Takuma Sakazaki (father)</li><li>Ronnet Sakazaki (mother, deceased)</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"4005-62621\" href=\"/yuri-sakazaki/4005-62621/\" slug=\"yuri-sakazaki\">Yuri Sakazaki</a> (sister)</li><li>King (love interest)</li></ul><p>Job/Occupation: Dojo owner and master</p><p>Likes: The motorcycle he rebuilt himself, Tatsumaki (the horse he received)</p><p>Dislikes: Pickles, bugs with a lot of legs</p><p>Hobbies: DIY carpentry, growing vegetables at home</p><p>Favorite food: Rice cakes, fermented soybeans</p><p>Forte in sports: Sumo wrestling</p><p>Favorite music: Country music</p><h2>Powers</h2><ul><li><b>Chi Gathering</b> - Ryo can gather ki from Gaia, the mother-earth.</li><li><b>Energy Projectile</b> - Ryo can fire the Kouken and Haoh Shou Kouken blast normally.</li><li><b>Multiple Attacks</b> - Ryo can channel his ki energy into his arms to deliver multiple punches at a very fast ratio.</li></ul><h2>Fighting Style</h2><p>Kyokugenryu Karate</p><h2>Video game appearances</h2><p><b>Art of Fighting</b></p><li><b>Art of Fighting 2</b></li><li><b>Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior</b></li><li><b>Art of Fighting Anthology</b></li><li><b>Fatal Fury Special</b></li><li><b>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 94</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 94: Re-bout</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 95</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 96</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 97</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 98</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 99</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters: The Dream Match 1999</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters: Evolution</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters R-1</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters R-2</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2000</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2001</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2003</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2006</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XI</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XII</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XIII</b></li><li>King of Fighters Kyo</li><li>King of Fighters: Maximum Impact</li><li>King of Fighters: Neowave</li><li>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000</li><li>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</li><li>Capcom vs SNK2: Mark of Millennium</li>",

      "description": "<h2>Origin</h2>The son of a skilled pilot, Davy Nelson was raised around planes, and soon showed himself to be an exceptionally skilled pilot in his own right. He was close friends with a Franciscan monk, Brother Francis Martier, who was himself a keen flyer. Martier invented a revolutionary new plane, but died during its testing. The plane was left to Davy, as was a uniform that had allegedly been in Martier's family for over a century. Wearing the costume and flying the plane left to him, Davy became Airboy.  <br /><h2>Creation</h2>Airboy was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-1351\" href=\"/charles-biro/4040-1351/\">Charles Biro</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-59911\" href=\"/dick-wood/4040-59911/\">Dick Wood</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-48497\" href=\"/al-camy/4040-48497/\">Al Camy</a>. He was updated for the Modern Age by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-15861\" href=\"/timothy-truman/4040-15861/\">Timothy Truman</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4040-41486\" href=\"/chuck-dixon/4040-41486/\">Chuck Dixon</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4040-25603\" href=\"/stan-woch/4040-25603/\">Stan Woch</a>.  <br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age </h3>In the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-55820\" href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/4015-55820/\">Golden Age</a>, Davy was a young boy who fought in the Second World War. The Golden Age also witnessed the introduction of most of his major supporting characters and villains, including <a data-ref-id=\"4005-47056\" href=\"/valkyrie/4005-47056/\">Valkyrie</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\" href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\">German</a> pilot and later ally and love interest. Unusually for a comic book character, Davy aged more or less in real time. <br /><h3>Modern Age</h3>In the <a data-ref-id=\"4015-56028\" href=\"/modern-age-of-comics/4015-56028/\">Modern Age</a>, the role of Airboy is played by David Nelson III, the son of the original Airboy. Many members of his supporting cast were brought forward in time. <br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>World War II </h3>Airboy fights as an independent operator on the side of the Allies during the Second World War. During this time he fights numerous supervillains, including Misery, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-30639\" href=\"/the-heap/4005-30639/\">Heap</a> and Valkyrie<br /><h3>After the War </h3>Following the conclusion of the war, Davy spends some time acting as a pilot and mercenary. Eventually he retires to <a data-ref-id=\"4020-55716\" href=\"/california/4020-55716/\">California</a>, where he raises his son, David Nelson III, and runs an aircraft manufacturing company.    <br /><h3>The New Airboy  </h3>Davy is assassinated by South American mercenaries, which prompts his son to investigate. His son discovers his father's history as Airboy, as well as locating his plane and costume. The boy takes up the mantle of Airboy and continues his father's tradition of adventuring and crime fighting. <br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Davy is a very talented pilot, capable of flying most aircraft. He possesses a semi-sentient plane with a revolutionary flapping wing design, referred to affectionately as \"Birdie\". He is a competent hand-to-hand fighter and capable with some weaponry. In his later years, he became fairly wealthy.",

New Texas has a native population of small humanoids resembling praire dogs called “Prarie People” and is home to a mineral called Kerium, a rare and powerful crystal of great importance in spacefaring societies. Bravestarr works for the inter-planetary gvoernment that colonized New Texas and spends much of his time keeping this mineral from his enemy, Tex Hex, and other less than reputable opportunists.</p><p>The culture of the New Texas colony (inhabited predominantly by humans but also by various aliens and robots) bears a remarkable resemblance to the culture of the American West.</p><p>In addition to Kerium mining, the planet is also the site of \"solacow\" ranching. \"Solacows\" are large cattle-like creatures. As a Law-man of New Texas, Bravestarr carries a “Neutra-laser”, but is best known for his Native-American powers. These powers were taught to him by a shaman and draw from \"spirit animals.\"</p><h2>Spirit Animal Powers</h2><ul><li><strong>Eyes of the Hawk</strong>: allowing him to see great distances</li><li><strong>Ears of the Wolf</strong>: endowing him with super-hearing</li><li><strong>Strength of the Bear</strong>: granting him super-strength</li><li><strong>Speed of the Puma</strong>: empowering him with super-speed</li></ul>",

He was the second and sickly child to <a href=\"../../elizabeth-howlett/29-44325/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Elizabeth</a> and <a href=\"../../howlett-senior/29-44326/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Howlett Sr.</a> His mother was ill and, in the early 1900s, a young Irish girl named <a href=\"../../rose/29-44342/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rose O'Hara</a> was brought to the Howlett estate to be a friend and a caretaker to young James.

Dog tried to form a normal bond between the two, but due to his father’s resentment and drunken abuse, he grew to resent his station in life; so much so that one day he makes undue advances on Rose, which are reported by young James to his father. This whole chain of events leads to <a href=\"../../thomas-logan/29-44323/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Thomas Logan</a> being sacked from his position as groundskeeper, following which he goes seeking for <a href=\"/elizabeth-howlett/4005-44325/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44325\">Elizabeth Howlett</a>, trying to convince her to leave with him.

What they don’t know is that by night, he runs in the wild with a pack of wolves that he is cowed the alpha of. Dog arrives one day, having survived his encounter years ago, still holding a massive grudge against Logan. Logan recognizes his erstwhile friend and accepts his challenge to a brawl to the death. Before Logan can kill Dog, however, Rose tries to pull him away and is inadvertently stabbed through the chest, killing her and leaving Logan to mourn alone.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/79548-18133-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79548\" data-ratio=\"1.288\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:128.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/229/79548-18133-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79548\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/229/79548-18133-wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/229/79548-18133-wolverine.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></a></figure><p>Wolverine was created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein and John Romita, Sr..

She reciprocates, and the two share a cabin together in the woods and live happily for a time. In late May, when Logan believed his birthday to be, <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sabretooth</a> tracks and murders Silver Fox after seeing her and Wolverine together, envious that Logan had found a measure of peace. Upon discovering the gruesome scene, Wolverine flew into a rage and battles Sabretooth, but couldn’t best his counterpart, who was able to keep his cool.</p><p>Sabretooth and a mysterious cloaked figure then manipulated the feral, mindless Logan to slaughter the inhabitants of the town he had been living in at the time.</p><p>Later, employed by The Hudson's Bay Company as a fur trader to the Blackfoot Indians, he defeated the demonic snake-worm known as Uncegila, a feat which earned him the Blackfoot warrior name of \"Skunk-Bear.\" A broad, largely unseen conspiracy then began to shape Logan, robbed of his conscience and free will, into the perfect killer. Wherever Logan went, Sabretooth or one of his handlers, was not far behind.</p><h3>World War I</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863610\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863610\"><img alt=\"Logan in the Great War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Logan in the Great War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1863610-logan_wwi.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Logan in the Great War</figcaption></figure><p>In 1914, Logan joined the Canadian Army to fight during The Great War.

Lazaer got the upper hand and impaled Wolverine with his sword, but Logan pulled the sword from his body, and impaled Lazaer to defeat him. Since then, every time Logan has had a near death experience, he has had to battle Lazaer so that he is able to return back to the realm of the living and use his advanced healing factor to return to health.</p><p>When the authorities became aware of Logan's abilities, he was assigned to a special unit of the Canadian military, The Devil's Brigade, tasked with the most suicidal missions in the war under the command of the super-humanly strong <a href=\"/cyber/4005-7597/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7597\">Silas Burr</a> (who later became the mercenary Cyber). After a falling out, Cyber murdered Logan's girlfriend and during the confrontation Logan was severely beaten and one of his eyes was removed, but he was able to escape. Cyber and Sabretooth tracked him at the bidding of <a href=\"/romulus/4005-34477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34477\">Romulus</a> and returned him to the squad where he was assigned to <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\">Madripoor</a>.</p><h3>Post-World War I</h3><p>After a stint in the small nation, Logan traveled to China where he turned down an offer from the warlord <a href=\"/ogun/4005-14836/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14836\">Ogun</a> to instruct him in the Art of War.

The two of them were going to be executed by firing squad, but escaped using their abilities and formed a small criminal syndicate. Wolverine and Mystique became romantically involved, but the relationship was short lived as Logan reported on their criminal doings to the police, thus sending the syndicate to prison and returning to Canada to take part in the <a href=\"/weapon-x/4060-5018/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5018\">Weapon X</a> program.</p><h3>World War II</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872411\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5181818181818\" data-width=\"660\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 660px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872411\"><img alt=\"Fighting against the Nazis\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 660w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fighting against the Nazis\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 660w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872411-wolverine16.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Fighting against the Nazis</figcaption></figure><p>During World War II, Logan teamed up with <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"../../bucky-barnes/29-40470/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bucky Barnes</a> in Madripoor. The two were unaware of his mutation, believing him to merely be extraordinarily lucky, and dubbed him “Lucky James.” One of their first significant missions was to rescue <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Natasha Romanova</a>, a young child at the time, from being brainwashed into an assassin by <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Hand</a>. <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/4005-4662/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4662\">Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker</a> was also implicated, causing Cap and Bucky’s attention to shift to the fascist <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> organization. During this time, <a href=\"/seraph/4005-9414/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9414\">Seraph</a>, guardian of Madripoor and another ex-lover of Wolverine, was killed by Sabretooth, presumably under the orders of a strange entity called Romulus. But who he was would not be revealed until years later. Logan decided to officially get involved in the war and enlisted in the Armed Forces, joining the First Canadian Parachute Battalion. It was with this battalion that he first encountered <a href=\"../../bloodscream/29-15734/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bloodscream</a>, an immortal being with vampire-like qualities and powers. He fought in various missions, already soon making a name for himself as one of the best soldiers in the division. He ended his stint living in Japan and possibly training as a samurai.</p><h3>After the War</h3><p>After WWII, Logan returned to Japan, having remembered Ogun's offer to train him. Logan would soon develop a deep love of Japan, particularly samurai culture and code of Bushido, that would stand the test of time. His training complete, he journeyed across the nation until he met the beautiful <a href=\"/itsu/4005-50424/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50424\">Itsu</a>, with whom he started a family. But Logan’s destiny was never one of peace, and after he accidentally killed a man during a disaster, he returned home to find Itsu dead and the child they conceived stolen by Romulus. Logan had nothing left in Japan and returned to Canada to once again join with Weapon X. It was then that he gained his trademark <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium</a> skeleton, but also lost his memory due to the trauma of the experiment before joining <a href=\"/alpha-flight/4060-14616/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14616\">Alpha Flight</a> and taking on the Hulk for the first time.</p><h3>Team X</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872413\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0253521126761\" data-width=\"710\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 710px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872413\"><img alt=\"Team X\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-width=\"624\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg 710w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg 624w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Team X\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg 710w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872413-509659_logan_team_x.jpg 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" data-width=\"624\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Team X</figcaption></figure><p>After his military duty and his return from Japan and his training there, Logan applied for the job of Special Agent for an American underground government organization. With extreme coincidence, Logan's mortal enemy Sabretooth turned out to have applied for the same 'job'. A fight erupted in the offices of the organization, but both were subdued. At this time it turned out, it was not just a normal organization where the two had come to. They were both given a memory wipe and had false memories implanted. All except for Logan's time in Japan was a complete mystery to him, and Logan had no recollection of his former feud with Sabretooth. He fought on various missions together with teammates <a href=\"/maverick/4005-8307/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8307\">Maverick</a> and <a href=\"../../john-wraith/29-3205/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Wraith</a>.

He was even forced to kill an entire town, wanting to test if Logan would do any assignment. His abilities were put to the test. Eventually, Logan was able to resist the mind-control and broke free from the facility (with help from the Winter Soldier).

He participated in a few missions for Department H and was even given a costume and secret identity; the Wolverine. Logan's most prominent mission was when he was asked to locate, and subdue the incredible Hulk. The Hulk was spotted in a Canadian forest, and Wolverine seemed to be the best operative to engage the \"Green Goliath\".

When it took too long, Wolverine was told to abort the mission and return to the helicopter, his ride back to Department H. During this time, Professor <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a> found out about Wolverine being a mutant and started to watch him more closely.</p><h3>Wolverine in the X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872419\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872419\"><img alt=\"Logan meeting Jean Grey.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Logan meeting Jean Grey.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872419-wolverine.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Logan meeting Jean Grey.</figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine first came into contact with the <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a> when Professor Xavier contacted the Canadian government to arrange a personal introduction. Knowing full well that Department H was exploiting Logan for their own purposes and that there was friction between Wolverine and his superiors, Professor X offered Wolverine a position with the X-Men on the spot. The Department official objected but Logan lashed out at him and accepted Xavier's offer to join his school and team. Unbeknownst to Logan, he had been released from the Department intentionally with implanted subliminal orders to assassinate Professor Xavier. Xavier was fully aware of this, however, and simply removed the implanted suggestion from Logan's mind. He promised to help Logan with his memory loss in exchange for his enrollment on the X-Men roster.</p><p>Logan joined simultaneously with a number of new X-Men from across the globe, including <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Banshee</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../sunfire/29-3175/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sunfire</a>, <a href=\"../../thunderbird/29-2174/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Thunderbird</a>, and <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Colossus</a>. Scott Summers (aka <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cyclops</a>) was already established as the leader of the team, but Logan caused immediate problems in their working relationship by bucking his authority and questioning his leadership of the team. The mission for which Logan and his fellow team members were recruited was an attempt to save the original X-Men team from the living island of <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\">Krakoa</a>. Following the successful mission, Logan (as well as many of the other new X-men) clashed with the original X-Men. In one such instance, Warren Worthington III (aka <a href=\"/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a>) noticed Logan flirting with X-Man <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> out in the yard. Feeling that Logan was out of line, a fight between the two X-Men almost ensued but Jean intervened. This was the beginning of a longstanding romantic tension between Logan and Jean Grey, although she remained in a committed relationship with Cyclops until her untimely death. Despite this tension with Logan, Jean and Cyclops were the only two original X-Men to remain with the team immediately after.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><h4>For full arc summary see: <a href=\"/phoenix-saga/4045-56154/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56154\">Phoenix Saga</a></h4><p>In a later mission, Wolverine and the other X-Men were taken captive by the newly returned <a href=\"/sentinels/4060-4296/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4296\">Sentinels</a>, giant robots whose main objective was to capture or kill mutants. The captives were taken into outer space to be imprisoned on a space station but managed to escape and return to earth via stolen space-shuttle. This proved catastrophic when the shuttle began to break up and Jean volunteered to fly the space-jet back to earth, risking exposure to cosmic rays. The shuttle reached Earth safely and crash landed in the Hudson river. Wolverine and the other X-Men managed to get off the sinking space shuttle, but feared for Jean's life. She burst from the water in a fantastic display of telekinetic power, seemingly born anew.</p><p>At the time the X-Men accepted this person as their own Jean Grey, but in reality it was a cosmic entity known as the <a href=\"../../phoenix-force/29-2164/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Phoenix</a> who had taken her place, copying Jean's body, personality, and memories and leaving the real Jean comatose in a cocoon on the bottom of the Hudson river. After the incident, the X-Men and the ersatz Jean performed various missions together, including facing down the mad Emperor <a href=\"../../dken/29-40902/\" rel=\"nofollow \">D'Ken</a> of the <a href=\"/shiar/4060-55854/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55854\">Shi'ar</a> <a href=\"/shiar-empire/4020-23199/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-23199\">Empire</a> who sought to rule or destroy the entire universe. During this mission the X-Men fought the Shi'ar <a href=\"/imperial-guard/4060-6097/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-6097\">Imperial Guard</a> on the surface of Earth's moon. In this fight, Logan faced and defeated a member of the Guard named <a href=\"../../fang/29-6090/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Fang</a>, briefly wearing the guardsman's costume after his own was torn. The X-Men defeated the Shi'ar, deposed D'ken, and put the fallen Emperor's sister, <a href=\"../../lilandra/29-6144/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lilandra</a>, on the throne in his place.</p><p>After the team returned home, Logan's former friend and Alpha Flight teammate the Guardian turned up unannounced and attacked the team in an attempt to bring Logan back to Canada, no matter the cost. He was defeated and sent back to Canada empty handed. The Guardian would try to recapture Logan again, this time with the help of Alpha Flight, but once again Wolverine evaded capture and remained with the X-Men, seemingly unconcerned that he was wanted by the Canadian government. During this time Logan began to develop close personal connections with his teammates that were uncommon for him. He grew especially close with Colossus, Storm, and Nightcrawler.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872673\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"312\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 312px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872673\"><img alt=\"Wolverine meeting Mariko Yashida. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-width=\"312\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg 312w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine meeting Mariko Yashida. \" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super.jpg 312w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" data-width=\"312\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine meeting Mariko Yashida. </figcaption></figure><p>Logan even seemed to develop a friendly relationship with Xavier whereas before he'd repeatedly rebelled against authority figures, although Logan still annoyed Xavier by insisting on referring to him with nicknames such as \"Chuck\" and \"Charlie\" rather than as \"Professor Xavier\" or even the more casual \"Charles.\" However, his relationship with \"Jean\" remained at an impasse as she continued to be devoted to Cyclops. Logan and the X-Men faced numerous threats during this time, and on one of these missions they traveled to Japan where Logan met and fell in love with a young Japanese woman named <a href=\"../../mariko-yashida/29-3196/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mariko Yashida</a>, abandoning his pursuit of the unresponsive Jean. After this mission, Logan often returned to Japan to visit Mariko and continue their courtship.</p><p>Some missions later, disaster struck when the being posing as Jean, now openly calling herself the Phoenix, was manipulated by the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>, a mutant organization bent on world domination. She was taken hostage and subjected to mental manipulation by <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-8306/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8306\">Mastermind</a>, transforming her into the Dark Phoenix, an entity with no remorse who fought with the Hellfire Club instead of against them. The X-Men tried to rescue her, but all were captured save Wolverine. Working alone, Logan fought his way through Hellfire Club soldiers, injuring many. Just as he successfully rescued the X-Men, the Dark Phoenix suddenly became extremely unstable. Now out of the control of even the Hellfire Club, she flew out of the Club's building in a rage and traveled to deep space, where she consumed an entire populated planet in her primal hunger.</p><p>After this horrific event, the Phoenix regained her normal \"Jean\" personality but remained highly unstable. This atrocity convinced the rulers of the Shi'ar Empire that the Phoenix, an entity that had been previously known to them, had to be destroyed, which meant killing Jean. The X-Men refused to surrender their teammate and fought for her life against the Shi'ar Imperial Guard once more on the dark side of Earth's moon. The Guard was winning the battle until the Phoenix fought back with her full might and in a burst of power knocked out almost the entire Guard, nearly killing them. After that, the \"Jean\" persona took control of the Phoenix and decided she was too far out of control and too dangerous to be left alive. She intentionally walked into the path of an automated laser cannon, allowing herself to be vaporized. The X-Men were devastated by her death, especially Cyclops and Logan, who had not moved past his desire for Jean as much as he'd let on. Cyclops decided to quit the team immediately after, leaving Storm to lead, but Wolverine stayed with the X-Men.</p><h3>Further Adventures &amp; Marriage?</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158133\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2706552706553\" data-width=\"351\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 351px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2158133\"><img alt=\"Do not mess with him!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-width=\"503\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg 351w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Do not mess with him!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg 351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" data-width=\"503\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Do not mess with him!</figcaption></figure><p>After Phoenix had died, hope came back to the X-Men and Wolverine in the form of young <a href=\"/kitty-pryde/4005-3548/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3548\">Kitty Pryde</a>. An uptown girl with the mutant ability to phase through any solid matter. As time went on, Wolverine became somewhat of a mentor to her, although she first found him to be scary. Cyclops returned during this time, with a new girlfriend named <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Madelyne Pryor</a> and took leadership of the X-Men once again. Logan and the X-Men soon found themselves in more trouble when space-pirates named the <a href=\"/starjammers/4060-14871/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-14871\">Starjammers</a> (whom they had encountered during their mission against the Shi'ar) asked for their help. The team went into outer space to help, but where captured by the alien race known as the <a href=\"/brood/4060-4987/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-4987\">Brood</a>. Some of the X-Men, including Wolverine, where implanted by a Brood egg, which would change it's host into another Brood. Logan managed to break free from captivity and his healing factor prevented the egg from hatching and killed the creature inside him.</p><p>After the X-Men defeated the Brood, they managed to return home once again. Only problem was that they had remained in space for a long time. During this time, Xavier thought the X-Men to be dead. Xavier, (who himself also got infected with a Brood egg by a Brood whio had traveled to earth) assembled a new team of mutants calling them 'the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a>'. When the X-Men returned, they found strange people living inside their home, and a fight erupted until they found out that it where the New Mutants and that they where no longer the youngest team of X-Men. The Brood Xavier had however hatched by this time, and though the X-Men and the New Mutants. They did defeat it, but the transformation to Brood and back took its toll on Xavier, he became very sick. Wolverine needed to get away for a while, so he decided to take a trip to the Canadian mountains.</p><p>After taking a vacation in the Canadian mountains Wolverine finds out that all of the letters he had been writing to his girlfriend, Mariko, were being returned. When he calls the embassy in New York that she was staying at he discovers that she was summoned back to Japan weeks ago. Logan then travels to Japan to find out what happened. There he discovers that Mariko has been married on her father's, Shingen Harada's orders. Logan travels to see her immediately after receiving this news. Logan finds her with bruises on her face and realizes that her husband has been beating her. Logan attacks Mariko's husband, but stops when she begs him not to hurt him. Logan then fights Mariko's father to prove that he is worthy of Mariko, but Logan loses due to being poisoned. Afterwards Shingen hires the Hand to kill Logan as well as the mercenary Yukio to kill Logan. Yukio lies to Logan, telling him that the Hand are after her. Logan agrees to help her. With Mariko seemingly being out of his reach Logan begins to develop a relationship with Yukio. When she fails to kill Logan Shingen sends the Hand after them again and Logan discovers that Yukio was Yukio working with Shingen, but she was the one that poisoned him costing him the duel for Mariko. After taking out the Hand Logan returns and fights Shingen once more but this time the fight he ends with Logan killing him with his claws. Mariko then says that her father was corrupt, and she was prepared to kill him herself and then take her own life in ritualistic suicide. Mariko and Logan then reconcile and plan to marry.</p><p>Wolverine had invited all his X-Men friends on the day of the wedding, but just before they wanted to say the 'I do', Mariko walked up to Logan and told him she did not love him. Logan was stunned, and above all, heartbroken. It turned out that this was not Mariko's own decision, but Mastermind's manipulating her, he was an old enemy to the X-Men. Wolverine fell into a deep angry mood. He however found some new excitement when ex-criminal and former enemy <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> joined the X-men. He had fought her once before in which she nearly killed him, but now she came to the X-Men in search of help to control her powers, and wanting to change her life. Almost nobody believed her, but Wolverine felt less mistrustful towards her and he took Rogue on a trip to Japan. There the two strangely enough soon become friends. She returned as a fully respected X-woman. Around the same time, the spirit of Wolverine's old Martial Arts trainer Ogun had taken an interest in Kitty Pryde. Kitty had gone to Japan in search of her father, but soon found herself mind-controlled by Ogun, who trained and manipulated her from beyond the grave.</p><p>Eventually, Wolverine managed to bring Kitty out of her trance and together they managed to stop Ogun, after which they returned to America. Wolverine and the other X-Men then entered the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Secret Wars</a>. Upon their return they where teleported to Japan and opposed a huge green dragon who ravaged the city. A building came down and a woman was mortally wounded. Wolverine rushed to her, hoping to save her, but it was already to late. With her dying breath she asked Logan to look after her daughter <a href=\"../../amiko/29-4992/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Amiko</a>, to which Logan gave her his promise. He became the foster-father to Amiko, and visits her as often as he can, but Logan gave her a home in Japan with his good friend and former lover <a href=\"../../yukio/29-9843/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Yukio</a>. Back in the United States, things went downhill for Charles Xavier. With a body that had to get back to health, Xavier remained very fragile. During a court-session in which former arch enemy <a href=\"/magneto/4005-1441/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1441\">Magneto </a>stood trail, Xavier collapsed during a fight and could only be saved if given medical care from the Shi'ar. Xavier left and Magneto became mentor to the New Mutants, and teammate to Wolverine and the X-Men at the same time. Many team-members did not trust Magneto, including Logan. Cyclops even left the team with his wife Madelyne Pryor and his newborn <a href=\"/cable/4005-2157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2157\">son</a>, started <a href=\"/x-factor/4060-24131/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-24131\">X-Factor</a> and left Storm in charge. However, they soon began trusting Magneto, becoming allies and even friends.</p><h3>Mutant Massacre</h3><h4>For full arc summary see: <a href=\"/mutant-massacre/4045-41407/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-41407\">Mutant Massacre</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872464\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2742382271468\" data-width=\"361\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 361px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:127.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872464\"><img alt=\"Classic Wolverine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" data-width=\"502\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg 361w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Classic Wolverine\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872464-2605_4_0207.jpg 361w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" data-width=\"502\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Classic Wolverine</figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine and the X-Men soon met their greatest threat yet, in the form of the mutant-hunting <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Marauders</a>. Under the tunnels of Manhattan lived the <a href=\"/morlocks/4060-3191/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3191\">Morlocks</a>, an underground civilization of mutants. Storm had become their leader after she had bested their former leader <a href=\"/callisto/4005-3423/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3423\">Callisto</a>. The X-Men were alerted by a giant \"mole-like' Morlock who stormed into the yard of Xavier' school. With his dying breath, he told them of a slaughter going on in the tunnels by a group of hunters. The X-Men soon went underground and into the tunnels. What they found was a large number of dead Morlocks. It was not soon before they found the Marauders and fought them, with heavy casualties. Colossus could not change back to his human form, Kitty stayed in her phasing form (becoming much like a ghost) and Nightcrawler was injured as well.</p><p>The X-Men found out that they were not alone in the tunnels, Cyclops' team, X-Factor was also fighting the Marauders with their own dramatic consequences (the former X-Men Angel lost his wings). The X-Men returned to the school with their casualties, but Wolverine went back into the tunnels to fight. There he first encountered the child super-team <a href=\"../../power-pack/65-40498/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Power Pack</a>. He was just about to tell them to leave the tunnels when he came eye in eye with Sabretooth. He noticed that Sabretooth had been slaughtering many more Morlocks, and was about to kill an old Morlock man with the gift to heal almost any injury, named the <a href=\"../../healer/29-13365/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Healer</a>. Logan knew how valuable the Healer could be in treating all the wounded Morlocks and got Sabretooth to let him go by saying \"you're fighting old men now, is that the best you can do or wanna try fighting against a real challenge\" namely, himself. His plan worked and a brutal fight erupted with Wolverine coming out victorious.</p><p>The Morlocks seemed to be saved from more harm, but not a few days later, Sabretooth re-emerged. He fought against Elizabeth Braddock, known as <a href=\"/psylocke/4005-3176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3176\">Psylocke</a>, a new recruit to the X-Men. She managed to hold him off long enough for Wolverine to arrive and finally making an end to the thread, pushing him off a cliff and into the water. For now, the mutants were saved. But the threat was far from over. While Cyclops seemed to have vanished, he left his wife Madelyne Pryor and his son unprotected for the Marauders who were now attacking there. The X-Men luckily were hot on their trail and saved Madelyne from certain death and they managed to defeat the Marauders at the same time. Madelyne then joined the team, she and Wolverine soon became good friends, with Logan calling her \"Maddy\". The X-Men's next mission was in Dallas, Texas. It ended with the X-Men giving their lives up in order to defeat an incredible thread called the Advisory.

On top of a mountain near the village was an Aboriginal mutant named <a href=\"/gateway/4005-4646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4646\">Gateway</a>, who teleported the X-Men to where ever they wanted to go. They had various missions, including a second encounter against the Brood and the team uncovered the horrible truth about mutants that were used as slaves on the island nation of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a>. After this the events of Inferno took place. The leader behind the Marauders, <a href=\"/mr-sinister/4005-3179/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3179\">Mister Sinister</a> made himself known. He turned out be to be the creator of Madelyne, who was a clone of Jean Grey. Through mind-control and Madelyne's sincere anger towards Cyclops for leaving her and her baby, she became the evil Goblin Queen.</p><p>Although Logan tried to reason with Madelyne, the battle that followed left Madelyne dead, and the X-Men feeling defeated. Logan however did find out that Jean Grey, who was believed dead for many years, was alive and working with X-Factor from the beginning. Upon completion of a mission, the X-Men teleported to their headquarters but unbeknownst to everybody, a girl named <a href=\"../../jubilee/29-4562/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jubilee</a> followed Wolverine into the portal and remained hidden in their headquarters for some time. Feeling lost and wanting to quit the lives they once led, the X-Men all went through a portal that erased their memories and scattered them around the earth. All except for Wolverine. He was attacked by the returned Reavers group who tried to reclaim their base. Being the only X-Men member left, Logan was defeated, nailed to a cross and left for dead. It was not until then that Jubilee made herself known. She rescued Logan by helping him off the iron X-shaped cross and they fled.</p><h3>Patch</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872428\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872428\"><img alt=\"Patch\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg 384w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Patch\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine.jpg 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Patch</figcaption></figure><p>With Jubilee as his only companion, Logan sets out in search of the other X-Men.

However, it turned out to be an imposter and the real Xavier was being held prisoner by some rogue Shi'ar agents. Wolverine found out about this and shocked teammates and enemies by stabbing the Xavier imposter in the chest. After the rogue Shi'ar had been defeated and the reinstatement of the real Xavier, the team went back home but encountered an evil entity known as the <a href=\"/shadow-king/4005-14889/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14889\">Shadow King</a>. He turned members of the X-Men against each other, resulting in numerous fights; chief among them: a fight between Wolverine and Gambit. The situation escalated, culminating in the Shadow King's defeat and Xavier losing the use of his legs once again.

However, nothing was further from the truth. Old ally and friend, Magneto had gone back to his old ways, and when he brought up nuclear weapons from a submariner he once sunk, claiming to only use them for defensive purposes, the X-Men lost all trust in Magneto's good intentions. Magneto was furious that the X-Men did not understand that they were still his allies. A fight broke out and Magneto was defeated. After his defeat, he told his former teammates that next time, they would meet as enemies. Sometime after these events, Wolverine's past finally came back to haunt him.</p><p>During a day off, Wolverine, Gambit, and Rogue were attacked and captured by an old enemy of Logan's; Omega Red. He had met Omega Red during his mission as a secret agent with Team X (which included Sabretooth, John Wraith, and Maverick). Logan, however, had no recollection of his past, and even when his former teammate Maverick came to help him and the X-Men break free, he still had trouble remembering who he was. This event however triggered Logan into looking into his past. He went back to the Weapon X labs with his X-Men friends. There, Logan started getting flashes of memories, re-living some of his most horrible memories. Logan was fully aware that not all of these memories were real, but he could not yet determine which was true, and which was false. During his visit to the laboratory, he even met a strange operative claiming to be Silver Fox, his former lover. She told him that she had not died when Sabretooth attacked her but joined the Weapon X program years later. Whether this claim was true or not remains to be seen. Logan finally started making some sense out of the wasteland that was his memory and was now happy to let the past rest. However, more trouble arose on the horizon.</p><h3>Losing the Adamantium</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66602/1826583-scan0010.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66602/1826583-scan0010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"Logan with bone claws\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66602/1826583-scan0010.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"Logan with bone claws\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/66602/1826583-scan0010.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Logan with bone claws</figcaption></figure><p>During an encounter with Magneto on the space station <a href=\"/avalon/4020-41283/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41283\">Avalon</a>, Wolverine cut Magneto with his claws. In retaliation, Magneto used the power of the magnetic field in space to tear the adamantium that laced Wolverine's skeleton out of his body. This cause extensive injuries, which shortened out Wolverine's healing factor for a while, and also revealed that Wolverine's claws, which he believed were a result of the Weapon X program, were in fact part of his actual bone structure. During this period, Professor Xavier, Beast, and <a href=\"/heather-hudson/4005-9846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9846\">Heather Hudson</a> were conducting experiments on Wolverine. They discovered that Wolverine's mutation was actually ongoing and that whilst his healing factor and senses accelerated it would eventually cost him his humanity, for it would eventually change him into a feral, wild animal-like creature. It was also discovered that the presence of the adamantium slowed down his mutation as his healing factor was constantly trying to expel it.</p><h3>Phalanx Covenant</h3><h4>For further details: <a href=\"/phalanx-covenant/4045-42176/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-42176\">Phalanx Covenant</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872420\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif\" data-ratio=\"0.8925\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872420\"><img alt=\"Bone Claws\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bone Claws\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/81783/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bone Claws</figcaption></figure><p>Because of the injuries he received, Wolverine left the X-Men team for a while and was asked by Kitty to make a visit to <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Muir Island</a>, where he was attacked by Cyber.

The Shiver Man failed, however, and Jackson managed to trap Logan with the help of a Nick Fury Life Model Decoy. An infuriated Fury decided to send the Shiver Man to monitor Jackson. Jackson was actually working for the renewed Weapon X program under new director Malcolm Colcord. Jackson's job was to retrieve Wolverine and imprison him in The Cage, a high-powered prison. Wolverine would then be handed over to Sabretooth, who was also working for Weapon X. Things however did not work out as they hoped since Wolverine managed to prove his innocence and had agent Jackson's cover blown. Jackson then had to flee <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> and started working permanently with the Weapon X program.</p><h3>New X-Men &amp; the Weapon Plus Program</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027930\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4653937947494\" data-width=\"419\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 419px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2027930\"><img alt=\"Wolverine in New X-Men. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-width=\"436\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg 419w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine in New X-Men. \" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/107793/2027930-newxmen_wolverine.jpg 419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-width=\"436\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine in New X-Men. </figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine rejoined the X-Men as a faculty member of Professor Xavier's newly reconstituted School for Gifted Youngsters, settling into his role as the tough-but-fair mentor to a younger generation of mutants.

Unwittingly aided in his earlier escape by Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, Fantomex had tracked the <a href=\"/weapon-plus/4060-40591/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40591\">Weapon Plus</a> program back to the place where he was created; a domed habitat known as <a href=\"/the-world/4020-41078/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41078\">The World</a>. The World was an experimental structure where the program operators could control the flow of time, allowing them to create a new breed of superhumans in the blink of an eye by introducing evolutionary factors into the environment and speeding up time within to reap the results. Seeking answers about their respective pasts, Wolverine and Fantomex set out for The World with Cyclops in tow.</p><p>As they came across the structure, it was in the midst of a siege from without by <a href=\"/aim/4060-13497/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13497\">AIM</a>, and from within by <a href=\"/ultimaton/4005-41077/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41077\">Ultimaton</a> (Weapon XV), the latest product of the Weapon Plus super sentinel program. The trio found themselves at odds with both the AIM remnants and the bizarre machinations of the World itself. Following Ultimaton as he broke free from the World and headed into space, the team discovered the base of operations for the Weapon Plus program: an orbital station. It was here that Wolverine discovered how and why he was turned into a guinea pig all those years ago, as well as the lineage of the program going all the way back to the Super Soldier project that created Captain America. Faced with the truth of what he is, Wolverine set the station to blow up, taking the tragic legacy of the Weapon Plus project with it.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903813\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.87092731829574\" data-width=\"798\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 798px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903813\"><img alt=\"The Death of Jean Grey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 798w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Death of Jean Grey\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 798w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/95970/1903813-jean_dies6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Death of Jean Grey</figcaption></figure><p>As the orbital station exploded, Jean Grey attempted to rescue Wolverine in a shuttle. Unfortunately for them, it was a trap sprung by the mutant known as <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\">Xorn</a>, who was really Magneto in disguise. He had lured them to the Weapon Plus satellite, which turned out to be built using remnants of <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\">Asteroid M</a>. With Wolverine and Jean trapped on board, Magneto flung the deteriorating station on a collision course with the sun. Wolverine was able to withstand the heat due to his healing factor, but Jean could not withstand the pain and asked Wolverine to kill her. In order to stop his love's pain, Wolverine killed Jean with his claws. Jean's death unlocked the power of the Phoenix Force, which created an oxygen bubble around Wolverine, which helped him heal.</p><p>Wolverine and Jean returned to Earth and confronted Xorn, alongside the other members of the X-Men. However, when Jean confronted Xorn, he injected her with a lethal electromagnetic pulse and she died in Cyclops' arms. Wolverine mourned Jean's loss greatly and was displeased about Cyclops' new relationship with <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> but still remained within the team, serving in many missions and even indulging in the occasional solo missions.</p><h3>Solo Adventures</h3><p>Wolverine is later sought out by a man who goes by the name of <a href=\"/mister-x/4005-15623/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15623\">Mister X</a>, who wishes to challenge Logan for the title of \"Best there is.\" After sending his underlings, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/4005-56791/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56791\">A</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/t/4005-56792/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56792\">T</a>, to capture Logan, he battles him.

He is to fight Mister X again, but he escapes. Logan later travels to Madripoor and enter a fighting tournament where he fights and finally defeats Mister X, while also getting his marriage to Viper annulled.</p><p>Logan later has Nightmares about murdering people. He then discovers that these dreams are actually memories that happened. With aid from the Beast, Logan hunts the trail to discover that a man known as The Director was behind it, discovering that he was brainwashed again. Wolverine manages to break free of the hold on him, and shuts down Weapon X, battling Sabretooth in the process.

The United States and Canada purge all of the records showing that Wolverine was</p><p>involved in their work in case he had a plan of revenge upon them. Their fears are proven when Wolverine visits Japan in search of knowledge of the mysterious sword called the Muramasa Blade. While in Japan, Wolverine seeks out the <a href=\"/silver-samurai/4005-3174/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3174\">Silver Samurai</a>, who is the bodyguard of Japan's prime minister. After they battle each other and Wolverine beats Silver Samurai by cutting off his hand, he explains that Wolverine did not escape the Weapon X program by himself as Bucky, Captain America's partner known as the <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Winter Soldier</a>, helped him break free.

The school itself is formed from Shi'ar technology and even has some parts of it that are floating in mid-air. In the beginning of this series, Wolverine and Kitty Pryde are attempting to get everything as ready as possible for an inspection that will determine whether or not the school can remain open. Professor Xavier makes his first appearance after Schism and tells Logan that even though he never would have imagined that he would open his own school for mutants, he could not think of anyone else better suited for the job and gives him his blessing. The master architect of Wolverine's new school is none other than Beast himself. The major staff of the school includes Wolverine, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey, Iceman, Beast, Gambit, Rogue, Chamber and Husk. The main goals of Wolverine's new school is to keep the children away from the fighting at all costs and not turn them into living weapons.</p><p>But unfortunately a number of things occur that gets the children directly involved in a number of problems. Apparently, the new Hellfire Club was fully aware of the fact that Wolverine had built his school on top of Krakoa. The new leader of the Hellfire club told Wolverine that he was the cause of the Sentinel attacking Utopia and driving the final wedge between his relationship with Cyclops. He also tells Wolverine that he will make it his personal mission to destroy the school. At that very moment, Krakoa begins to attack the students and destroys a major part of the school. Fortunately, Wolverine and his team were able to put an end to it after a great showing from Iceman. He created ice clones of himself in order to combat the monstrous living landscape. Reconstruction of the school begins soon after, as Wolverine and his staff are able to come to an agreement with it.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men</h3><h4>For full arc summary see: <a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers vs X-Men</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247475\" data-ratio=\"1.5193340494092\" data-width=\"1862\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1862px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247475\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" data-width=\"631\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 1862w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 631w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 1862w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85507/2247475-cyke_wolv_cap.jpg 631w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" data-width=\"631\"></noscript></a></figure><p>With the Phoenix Force on its way to Earth, Cap asks Wolverine for assistance.

Viper reveals she is not the one who wants Logan but that she was hired to capture him. Viper escapes an Logan is rescued by Lady Deathstrike right before Creed finishes him off. Lady Deathstrike reveals that Logan isn't the only one being hunted, and that it is members of the Weapon X program who have healing factors. She offers Wolverine to team up, but once she realizes Logan isn't healing she changes her mind and decided to capture Logan herself and bargain for her own life. Just before the fight can happen Logan is saved by Kitty Pryde. Upon reaching Japan, Wolverine discovers Kitty is possessed by their former master Ogun. After a brief fight, Kitty fights to regain control of her body and Ogun escapes to take control of an innocent bystander. Logan corners his adversary who threatens to kill his current host if Wolverine does not take the information he has and leave him alone. Logan agrees and Ogun reveals Dr. Abraham Cornelius is the man behind all this. Wolverine pays the former Weapon X scientist a visit and finds that Dr. Cornelius is experimenting with humans, trying to recreate Weapon X's success. The Dr. needed Wolverine to try and unlock the secrets of his healing factor, but upon hearing Logan no longer has it , he begins the adamantium bonding to his patients which will kill them, and proceeds to escape. Logan is left with a choice, capture Cornelius or save the test subjects. Wolverine slashes at the container holding the melted adamantium and it pours and hardens on his body, leaving him completely encased in adamantium.</p><h3>Return</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6073011\" data-ratio=\"1.5375\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6073011\"><img alt=\"Logan Returns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 1200w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Logan Returns\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 1200w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6073011-wolverine%20returns.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Logan Returns</figcaption></figure><p>The teenage, time-displaced Jean Grey eventually heads to Canada to visit Logan's grave.

He was then confronted by Loki, who tried to get the stone from him but Wolverine stabbed him and left, telling Loki he'll find the other gems. He decides to leave the gem at a drop location in Madripoor, hoping Black Widow would find it and take care of it.</p><h3>Return of Wolverine</h3><p>Wolverine returns to life but can't remember much of anything. He meets a scientist of a faction called Soitera, where the scientists asks to be killed and freed of them. He is killed by grenade that rolls in the room, and this triggers a memory for Logan.

She tells him about Soitera and their leader Persephone. They head to an island of Soitera. On the boat they were on, Wolverine fights Omega Red and Daken, who were taken over by Persephone. Wolverine defeats Daken by using his new hot claws and lighting up a gas line ejecting oil to catch Daken ablaze, where he falls into the ocean.

Logan is sent on a strike team to stop a mutant hating organization called ORCHIS, where they plan to unleash a Mother Mold. Wolverine ends up being the last surviving member of the strike team before he rides the station into the Sun, thus killing him. He is later reborn on Krakoa through a resurrection process used a group of mutants called The Five.</p><h3>Dawn of X</h3><p>On Krakoa, a group of modified assassins using Domino’s genetic code to gain access to the island infiltrate the island and kill Charles Xavier before Logan kills them. Wolverine is sent out to find more information on who killed Xavier. He is led to a facility outside of Seoul for a group creating anti-mutant soldiers.

Logan still surviving attacks the soldiers before rendered incapacitated again before Forge and Domino come to save him. Forge using a krakoan suit or armor shoves his legs back to his torso for him to heal and fight again. After the fight, he shares a drink with Domino on the shore of the beach.</p><p>Wolverine, Domino, and Kid Omega have been deployed to investigate the nation of Terra Verde, as they had come to be able to nearly recreate the abilities of Krakoa via telefloronic technology. They are attacked upon entering the ruins and Wolverine is taken to an altar and about to be sacrificed but the team is saved by Jean Grey, Black Tom and Sage. After the mission and return home, Wolverine is seen relaxing is one of Krakoa’s hot springs with Jean Grey, where the two end up sharing a kiss. With Colossus being apprehended to undergo a psychic interrogation for having any possible knowledge on what the Russians are planning, Wolverine scares off the spectators Beast gathered before punching him about his treatment against Piotr. Logan brings in Jean to do the mental scan on Colossus. With Omega Red also apprehended, Logan wishes to kill him due to his enthrallment by Dracula, however, Beast persuades to use Omega Red as a double agent.</p><p>With a parasitic like off-shoot of Krakoa infesting the waters causing zombified creatures to attack, Wolverine, Forge and Quire head to the depths of the ocean. They encounter more zombified humans and creatures that have been taken over by this parasite and under water Logan brushes up against a leviathan of a god. They soon are surrounded by more and more creatures only for them to be saved by Namor. He tells them to return to Krakoa, but if they continue to return to the water, he will bring down the entire island himself.</p><h3>Pollen</h3><p>Wolverine wakes up with no memory of what happened but only finds the dead bodies of some of his fellow teammates, having slaughtered them. He is picked up by Agent Jeff Bannister and returned to Krakoa. He joins up with the agent to help stop the spread of a drug called “pollen” which is made of Krakoan flowers. The two venture off at sea where Wolverine is possessed once again by a psionic entity known as the Pale Girl, as he stabs Jeff in the back before commandeering the boat.</p><p>It’s revealed the Wolverine that stabbed Jeff was Kid Omega in a mental disguise. Wolverine prepares a plan the day prior to stop the Pale Girl by stealing Magneto’s helmet and bringing back up against the Pale Girl and the Russians. The mission is successful and Wolverine stops at Jeff’s house with Krakoan medicine to help his daughter get over her illness. Amidst talks for food, Logan is called home but not without leaving a portal gate at Jeff’s house.</p><h3>There Will Be Blood</h3><p>Wolverine is requested to meet with Xavier and Magneto about running a secret mission against the Russians, and they ask to him to openly communicate with them, but he leaves. He heads through a secret gate he planted to go far North to a small bar called the Red Tavern in the middle of the snowy wilderness. He gets into a fight with a man in there but is unknowingly drugged before being fully tranquilized. The group in there planned on capturing Logan, stating themselves as a mutant trauma group, all having suffered from Logan in some capacity. They drag him to a frozen lake and cut a hole into it, sending Logan in the icy waters below to freeze. As Logan falls in, Omega Red reveals himself, killing the group and slithering his tentacles into the water to grab Logan while an army of vampires descends from the sky.</p><p>In a small shack Wolverine is frozen in ice as Dracula and a few of his followers drain him of some of his blood as his blood can make them daywalkers, albeit temporarily. A group of younger vampires enter the shack and steal Logan while he is in his icy prison. As they are driving their snowmobiles through the woods, Wolverine breaks free and attempts to kill them. They reveal they were trying to rescue him as they don't like Dracula themselves. Wolverine and the young vampire trio trail and hunt down a couple of Dracula's lieutenants and he kills them. While walking through the woods, Wolverine is picked up by the Bifrost.</p><p>Continuing to battle the vampires, Wolverine hunts and kills them.

She explains to him that Father Cole, their leader, betrayed them. She reveals she‘s been turning to into a vampire. They are attacked by Father Cole, but Wolverine fends him off, impaling him. Meeting with Omega Red again, Arkady reveals that Dracula wants Wolverine, as his healing factor will allow the vampires to become Daywalkers. With Beast’s and Dr. Boggs’ help, they use a clone Wolverine with his blood filled with a plankton that creates its own bioluminescence that acts as a bomb to the vampires. Wolverine and Omega Red infiltrate Dracula’s ranks with the clone Wolverine battle more of the vampires. Dracula kills Dr. Boggs but manages to escape. Later, Wolverine joins Louise to Sevalith, the otherworldly dimension of the vampires, to meet with their leader to form an alliance against Dracula.</p><h3>X of Swords</h3><p>With a cross-dimensional fight on the horizon between the the Otherworld’s Arrako and Krakoa, Wolverine is selected as one of ten champions to fight. Requiring a sword, specifically the Muramasa blade, Logan travels to Japan to find Muramasa the swordsmith. He travels to an area that is between Earth and Hell and locates Muramasa and must now save him, while finding our he works for the Hand to save his village. Logan lands in the fiery lava of the hell hole while fighting the hand. His skeleton is placed in a cell with the warrior of Arrako named Solem, also looking for Muramasa. When he heals he tries to attack him, only to find out his skin is adamantium enforced. Wolverine and Solem interrupt a wedding of the Hand where Muramasa gives them two Muramasa blades and the couple kills him. Solem attacks and takes one blade only to find it can cut adamantium. Wolverine attacks the Beast with Solem taking both swords and offers one to Logan for a price. Logan leaves Hell and returns to Krakoa, wondering if the price he paid was worth it.</p><p>Wolverine is tasked with battling Summoner of Arakko in a battle to the death. They fight through the reality altering dimension of the Blightspoke, being torn to pieces yet coming back together. Wolverine ends up winning by killing Summoner, but loses the point as it was a battle to who would die first. After the fight, Wolverine joins Storm for a drink in Saturnyne’s bar. Logan is teleported to a battle between Solem and the Horseman War, as Solem cashes in his deal with Logan, but not before telling War he killed her son, Summoner. The drink messes with Wolverine‘s healing factor and he is drunk. Wolverine ends up defeating her by slicing off her hand in a battle to slice off an appendage. But as Logan was in place of Solem, Arakko got the point yet again. Wolverine was present for the final battle between Arakko and Krakoa.</p><h4>The Ties That Bind</h4><p>Wolverine walks through the gate he planted at Jeff Bannister's house to talk about CIA business, but they regale in old war stories and have a beer. Wolverine returns back to Krakoa where, Gabbie and Daken draw out Omega Red and attack him for information about Agent North, but soon he is over powered by Arkady, with Omega Red telling him to not make an enemy of friends before letting him go. Wolverine is called to the Pointe by Sage and Beast where they discuss an attack that happened at a government black site in Utah, it regards Team X. They find out from a blood profile that the merc was a mutant, and with Logan being on Krakoa along with Creed, they deduce the agent to be Maverick. Logan is sent to Dazzler's home in San Diego where the mercenaries show up, he attacks them, but recognizes one of the agents. He captures him and interrogates the merc where he reveals they've been doing jobs for a placed Legacy House that specialize in super hero and villains. Before much more is revealed the merc is killed from an unknown assailant from the shadows. Beast and Sage dress Logan up and send him to Madripoor to attend the Legacy House auction, with the funds necessary to blend in. Logan in doing so once again dons the identity of Patch.</p><p>Wolverine enters the auction and discovers a severed hand of his. In his disgruntlement, he shatters the glass of his drink, catching the attention of a viewer. She uses a facial recognition of his nose and jaw to figure out he’s Wolverine. When a mind wiped Maverick is brought out out, Logan starts bidding on him. His cover is soon blown and one of the auctioneers uses magnetic gloves to restrain Logan, but Logan calls to Maverick, breaking the mind control he is under to save him, albeit having no memory. Wolverine and Maverick fight off the hired guns at the auction and escape from Madripoor with the help of the Mercs. Maverick gets more of his memory back and asks Logan for help with one more job. They infiltrate a base in Houston and find files on various different superhero factions and events, and one marked Team X, where Logan burns it.</p><h3>Fox Hunt</h3><p>Wolverine is sent to Madripoor as Christian Frost was found burned and unconscious with the logic diamonds missing. Wolverine hunts down information to who did this as it takes him to Sevyr Blackmore, Arakii pirate lord with acidic blood. Wolverine meets with him and he believes it was Solem. Wolverine attempts to fight Sevyr, but he made magnetic floors to prevent Logan from moving. He commands Logan find and bring him Solem, to which Logan initially refuses, until Solem shows he has one of the Muramasa Blades in his possession as Solem ditched the blade. In return for Solem, Blackmore offers Logan the blade.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>The most savage member of the X-Men known as Wolverine is a gruff loner with an immense sense of honor. Even though Wolverine is very honorable, brave and noble, he is also one of the most dangerous men in the world, mostly because he always tries to control his inner berserker and more savage side, and most of the time doesn't even mind dealing with his adversaries permanently for the greater good. Wolverine is seen as a father-figure by Black Widow, Jubilee, X-23, Armor and Shadowcat. Furthermore, Wolverine's love life has not been very successful, he has loved many women but most of them died. His love interests include Rose O'Hara, Itsu, Viper, Silver Fox, Phoenix, and Mariko. Wolverine doesn't trust many people, but he completely trusts Captain America, Nick Fury, Spider-Man, and Jean Grey.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Regenerative Healing Factor</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-172273\" data-ratio=\"0.855\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-172273\"><img alt=\"Wolverine can heal from any injury.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine can heal from any injury.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/3133/172273-73118-wolverine.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine can heal from any injury.</figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine's most prominent power is his healing factor. This allows Wolverine to heal from virtually any injury at an incredibly fast rate. This allows him take hits from class 100+ characters and continue fighting. He can regrow missing limbs, organs and has even regenerated from nothing but a skeleton. His healing factor grants him a high resistance to toxins and poisons- he was one able to consume enough Blowfish poison to kill 20 men with no discomfort. Large enough doses have proven effective at bypassing his healing factor. His healing factor prevents nerve strike attacks from working effectively on him as his healing factor bypasses the effect virtually instantaneously. His healing factor also grants him immunity to all Earthly diseases and it extends Wolverine's lifespan. Wolverine's healing factor depends on his body's state. So if Wolverine lacks sleep and proper nutrition for a time, it slows his healing abilities drastically.</p><h3>Superhuman Durability</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2997028\" data-ratio=\"0.89127105666156\" data-width=\"653\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 653px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2997028\"><img alt=\"Wolverine can survive being hit by a plane.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 653w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Wolverine can survive being hit by a plane.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 653w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2997028-albert-wolverine%2340-splatters_wolverine.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wolverine can survive being hit by a plane.</figcaption></figure><p>Wolverine possesses superhuman durability thanks to a combination of his healing factor and adamantium skeleton. This enables him to take attacks from class 100+ characters such as the Hulk, Thing, Wonder Man, Red Hulk, Juggernaut and so on while still being able to fight. Thanks to the adamantium bonding, his ligaments are also near unbreakable, preventing superhuman characters such as the Hulk or Ba'al from doing so much as dislocating a joint.</p><h3>Superhuman Acute Senses</h3><p>Another one of Wolverine's prime abilities is his acute senses that are many time greater than that of a human being and even surpass that of most animals on Earth. Wolverine has the ability to see vast distances with complete clarity. This advanced eyesight also allows Wolverine to see in almost complete darkness. Wolverine's hearing is also enhanced allowing him to hear from great distances as well as hear pitches that ordinary human beings cannot and even fight blindfolded. These abilities also allow Wolverine to recognize people by their scent even if they are in a shape shifted state like beings such as Mystique and Morph. Wolverine is also one of the best trackers in the Marvel universe as he is able to track objects as well as human over very great distances. Wolverine has also been seen to be a human lie detector as he can hear a person’s heartbeat increase when they lie and also identify certain changes in their body such as increase in perspiration. Wolverine's sense of taste is also enhanced, allowing him to not only smell, but taste pheromones in the air such as when he made mention of training with Jean Grey in the Danger Room.</p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><p>Wolverine is superhumanly strong. His strength can range from 1,200 lbs to no more than 2 tons. Wolverine has swung tree trunks around like baseball bats, held an elevator with one hand, throw dumpsters, motorcycles, and even lifted and threw a dozen men with a single arm. He is also capable of striking beyond his strength range, having knocked out super durable foes like <a href=\"/roughouse/4005-15731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15731\">Roughhouse</a>, Caliban and Spider-Man, although he caught the latter with a sucker punch.</p><h3>Superhuman Agility</h3><p>Wolverine's balance and agility as well as his body coordination is beyond the capabilities of a human being at its peak and is well into the superhuman range. Wolverine has also been seen to jump nearly 30 feet in the air unassisted.</p><h3>Enhanced Speed</h3><p>Wolverine is able to move at low level superhuman speeds. He has attacked faster than the eye could follow, enabling him to blitz opponents before they realize what is happening. He has shown he can keep up with characters like Spider-Man or the Gorgon in combat, and even hit faster characters such as Speed Demon.</p><h3>Superhuman Reflexes</h3><p>Wolverine possesses enhanced reflexes.

Weapon X is recruited by Magneto’s X-Men, though he’s reticent to at first. Jean Grey convinces him, however, as their legendary romance begins. When Mr. Sinister abducts Jean, Weapon X is furious to learn that Magneto and the X-Men find it too dangerous to rescue her. Angered, Logan leaves the X-Men and goes after Sinister and Jean all by himself. He is however stopped by Cyclops, one of Sinister's most loyal soldiers. Cyclops and Weapon X start a brutal fight, in witch one of Logan’s hands is obliterated by Cyclops' force-beam. Logan however manages to gouges out one of Cyclops’ eyes. After the fight, Wolverine managed to rescue Jean from Sinister and the two made their escape. They however did not return to the X-Men, still angry about not coming to Jean's rescue. Weapon X and Jean become somewhat of a fighting duo, still fighting against the hordes of Apocalypse, but more stealth and only on some occasions working together with the X-Men.</p><p>Weapon X and Jean came into contact with the Human Council, located in a war torn London. There they where thinking about the possibilities of nuking New York City, the strong hold of Apocalypse. A mayor fleet of airships eventually set out to New York. The Human Council however knew that this would not go unnoticed and they asked Weapon X and Jean to accompany the fleet. Weapon X and Jean however got separated during an evacuation. They promised each other to meet again, back in New York. Logan went his way and accompanied the fleet. This was not for no reason, as the ships where soon attacked by some of Apocalypse's soldiers. One of them was Carol Danvers, a former close friend to Weapon X, but she was changed into something less then human. Weapon X killed her, the fleet went on and he managed to return to New York City, right at the moment when the final battle against Apocalypse went on. During this time, Jean and former archenemy Cyclops, who had changed sides and was now pro-human, had found each other and had become uneasy allies.</p><p>They tried to help humans escape the city, until Havok, Cyclops brother, seemingly first killed Jean, and then Cyclops. Weapon X was just about to meet Jean on the rendezvous point when he saw this scene happening. Weapon X lashed out at Havok, killing him instantly. He then ran up towards Jean, telling each other how much they loved one another. At that point, the reality known as the Age of Apocalypse seemingly dissolved, right at the moment that the nukes where about to be dropped. A great big white flash was seen and the reality seemed to vanish. This, however turned out not be the end. The reality remained and Jean had somehow managed to stop the bombs from going off. She even revived and turned into a strange Phoenix like entity. Weapon X recently is seen when the 616 Uncanny X-Force team travels to the Age of Apocalypse reality. He had taken the place of Apocalypse, wearing similar armor and replacing his missing hand with an energy cannon.</p><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</h3><h4>The Tomorrow People</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5078051\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png\" data-ratio=\"0.86363636363636\" data-width=\"572\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 572px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5078051\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Wolverine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 572w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Wolverine\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 572w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5078051-wolverine-%28earth-1610%29.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Wolverine</figcaption></figure><p>In this universe we first meet Wolverine as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.

Fifty years later Wolverine, now an pacifist, old farmer, lives on property owned by the Hulk gang and must travel cross-country with a now blind Clint Barton to get enough money to make rent before the Hulks kill his family. Wolverine says he doesn't fight anymore because of what the villians did to him. It is later revealed that Wolverine killed a majority of the X-Men because Mysterio made them look like supervillians. After that tragic moment, Wolverine swore to never pop out his claws again. He and Clint take the Spider Buggy, once owned by Spiderman, to get the money Clint will earn when he delivers a mysterious package. During their journey, they encounter a symbiote t-rex, save Clint's daughter who is also the granddaughter of Spiderman, and face the Kingpin. When they finally reach their destination, Clint delivers his package to an underground resistence, and it was a case of Super Soldier Serum. Unfortunately, the clients that hired Clint turned out to be working with the Red Skull. They shoot at Wolverine and Hawkeye, killing Clint. However, Wolverine's healing factor saves him and he awakens at the Red Skulls trophy room. The room is full of torn apparel and belongings of fallen superheroes, like Iron Man's armor and Captain America's shield. Wolverine uses Cap's shield to kill the Red Skull and he uses the Iron Man armor to fly home with the money. But when he arrives home, the Hulk's grandchildren had already killed his family, and their lifeless bodies lay motionless on the floor. This causes Wolverine to finally use his claws once more. He finds and kills the entire Hulk clan before encountering Banner himself, who displays extraordinary strength even in his human form. When he turns into the Hulk, Banner consumes Logan. But hours later, Logan heals inside Banner's stomach and kills him from within him. he later discovers the Hulk's own bay son, Bruce Banner Junior. A month later, Logan and his neighbors hold a small memorial for Logan's family. Logan and Bruce Banner Junior ride into the sunset after he tells them that he plans to defeat all the new world villains and thereby bring peace.</p><h4>Berserker</h4><p>After the event Secret Wars, Logan is transported to Earth-616. After realizing he is in the past he thinks the reason he is there is to kill the villians that took over the world in his time. He remembers in his own time when he took his son to the market they came across Butcher, who stole his sons hat. Logan gets a pen and writes some names on his arm. He then tracks down Butcher and kills him. We see the other names he is after are Red Skull, Bruce Banner, and Mysterio. Next Logan goes after Hulk. After fighting him he realizes that it is not Banner, but instead someone else. Logan gets pretty banged up from the fight, so he goes to Hawkeye's place to heal. There he meets Kate Bishop. He tells her his story and she insists in helping him. She tells him the location of Mysterio and they go after him, but Kate seems to have second thoughts when she sees that Logan is out for blood. They get into a fight with Logan escaping and then running into Steve Rodgers. Logan doesn't believe that it is Steve Rodgers at first, due to Steve still appearing old at this time. They start to fight, but Steve manages to tranquilize Logan, and then he takes him to the body of this world's Wolverine. After realizing that this is not his timeline, Logan leaves and wonders through the mountains and eventually runs into Storm and the X-Men.</p><h4>Rejoining the X-Men</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5095829\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5075376884422\" data-width=\"796\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 796px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5095829\"><img alt=\"Old Man Logan with the X-Men\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 796w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 636w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 424w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Old Man Logan with the X-Men\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 796w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 636w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111253019/5095829-extraordinary_x-men_vol_1_1_textless.jpg 424w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Old Man Logan with the X-Men</figcaption></figure><p>Storm tries to recruit Jean Grey to join her group of X-Men.

His father, <a href=\"/jakob-eisenhardt/4005-58084/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58084\">Jakob Eisenhardt</a>, was a <a href=\"/world-war-i/4015-56026/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56026\">World War I</a> veteran and a proud German. The family struggled against discrimination and hardship during the <a href=\"/third-reich/4060-49867/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49867\">Nazi</a>'s rise to power, the Nuremberg laws, and Kristallnacht. In the early 1930's, the family fled to Poland, where they were captured during the Nazi invasion and sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. They managed to escape the ghetto, but were captured again. Max's <a href=\"/edie-eisenhardt/4005-70787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70787\">mother</a>, father, and <a href=\"/ruth-eisenhardt/4005-58086/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58086\">sister</a> were executed, but Max survived (potentially thanks to an early manifestation of his powers) and was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp.</p><p>There, Max became a Sonderkommando, forced to dispose of gas chamber victims. While at the camp, Max was reunited with a girl he had fallen in love with during his school days named <a href=\"../../magda/29-45372/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Magda</a>. Max and and Magda escaped when Auschwitz was liberated and were soon married. They moved to the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, where they started their new lives together. Max adopted the name \"Magnus\" and Magda gave birth to their daughter who they named <a href=\"/anya/4005-45373/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45373\">Anya</a>.</p><p>Magnus worked as a carpenter to support the family and for a time they lived happily. One night Magnus was attacked and instinctively lashed out with his <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a> powers of magnetism (which had never surfaced before due to a bout of scarlet fever as a child), killing the attackers. Later that evening, he returned home to find his house on fire, with Anya trapped inside. Magnus rushed inside to rescue her but he was too late. Enraged at the death of his beloved daughter, he used his new powers to kill the surrounding mob that started the fire. Magda, terrified of her husband's strange abilities, fled to the forest and never saw her husband again.</p><p>Magda made her way to <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/4020-41286/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41286\">Wundagore Mountain</a>, where she gave birth to twins Pietro and Wanda (who would grew up to be <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Quicksilver</a> and <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scarlet Witch</a>, respectively). Magda later disappeared, presumed deceased. During the next few years Magnus had an identity forger named Greg Odekirk create him a new identity, reinventing himself as a gypsy named \"Erik Magnus Lehnsherr\". It was while using this identity that he went to <a href=\"/israel/4020-55950/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55950\">Israel</a> to help at a psychiatric hospital. There, he met <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Professor Charles Xavier</a>. The two became fast friends, playing chess and having intellectual debates about mutation and the future of mankind.</p><p>When <a href=\"../../baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker</a> attacked a young patient named <a href=\"/gabrielle-haller/4005-15049/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15049\">Gabrielle Haller</a>, Xavier and Magnus used their powers in order to save her. Following the battle, Charles and Magnus realized they had very differing ideologies. Magnus disappeared and the two friends would not meet again for many years. During the next few years, Magnus worked for the <a href=\"/cia/4060-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55745\">CIA</a> hunting Nazis, but this association ended when they murdered a girl he was becoming close to. Magnus would not be seen again until he became the mutant known as Magneto.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Magneto was created by writer <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Jack Kirby</a> in 1963. He made his first appearance in <a href=\"/x-men-x-men/4000-6694/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-6694\">X-Men #1</a>, becoming the very first foe of the iconic mutant team. Creator Stan Lee stated that he \"did not think of Magneto as a bad guy. He was just trying to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist. He was trying to defend mutants, and because society was not treating them fairly, he decided to teach society a lesson. He was a danger of course, but I never thought of him as a villain.\" Lee also explained that he originally planned for Magneto to be Professor Xavier's brother rather than simply an old friend. His face without the mask was not shown until X-Men #62 drawn by Neal Adams and written by Roy Thomas when they penned the famous line, \"perhaps clothes do make the man!\"</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-75992\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/75992-37608-magneto.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5228426395939\" data-width=\"394\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 394px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/75992-37608-magneto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-75992\"><img alt=\"The X-Men's Oldest Foe\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75992-37608-magneto.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75992-37608-magneto.jpg 394w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" data-width=\"394\"></a><figcaption>The X-Men's Oldest Foe</figcaption></figure><p>In his initial appearances, Magneto was portrayed as a would-be tyrant, who had a desire to punish all human and would often abuse his subjects (he physically abused <a href=\"/toad/4005-1470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1470\">Toad</a>, one of the members of the <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/4060-17652/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-17652\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, while Scarlet Witch was psychologically tormented into obedience, as Magneto saved her life in the past). Eventually, (as Marvel did with many of their long-lasting villains over the years) Magneto was given a more humanized portrayal as a Holocaust survivor who wanted to ensure that mutants would not suffer the same fate his family did for being born different.</p><p>Magneto has long been the face of mutant separatism, in opposition to Charles Xavier's ideal of coexistence with humanity. Believing that mutants are the next stage in human evolution, he sought to assert their dominance over the planet and its inhabitants. This was Magneto's means of assuring the survival of his people in a world that hates and fears them for there very existence. Though not a hero, Magneto is charismatic, noble, and wise. His long and turbulent friendship with Charles Xavier has been a cornerstone for both men's lives, as a rivalry that has lasted decades.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>War on Humanity</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2404436\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4675\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2404436\"><img alt=\"The Mutant Brotherhood\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-width=\"436\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Mutant Brotherhood\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/109227/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px\" data-width=\"436\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Mutant Brotherhood</figcaption></figure><p>After years of lying low, Magnus eventually resurfaced, now using the identity of \"Magneto\" bursting into the public eye. He attacked <a href=\"/cape-citadel/4020-41284/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41284\">Cape Citadel</a>, but was stopped by the original <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>, a confrontation that would spark a decades long rivalry. Some months later, Magneto was seen leading a team of mutants witch he mockingly named the <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brotherhood of \"Evil\" Mutants</a>. This group consisted of a few mutants including, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These young mutants where actually his daughter and son, but none of them knew at the time.</p><p>Demanding not merely equal rights, the Brotherhood sought supremacy for mutant-kind. Their vicious attacks against humans led them to attract the attention of Professor Xavier and his X-Men, whom where often able to repel the group. Magneto did however not just fight against the X-Men but many other superhero groups such as the Avengers and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>. During one of Magneto's plans, Professor Xavier sought the help of the superheroes team known as the <a href=\"/defenders/4060-26333/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26333\">Defenders</a>.

Although shaken by the events and perhaps changed for good, Magneto still sought out to win his war against humanity. Now once again in his physical prime (and stronger than before), Magneto battled the X-Men on <a href=\"/muir-island/4020-43505/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43505\">Muir Island</a> before disappearing. He would later return to capture the X-Men, but was badly injured after being attacked by Wolverine.

Stricken with the revelation that he’s become a horrific extremist, willing to murder even children to achieve his goals, Magneto renounces his terrorist ways. He seeks out his former wife <a href=\"/magda/4005-45372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45372\">Magda</a> and learns of her death, but also the truth about <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a>: that they are his children. While the pair accept that he’s their father, they reject Magneto's leadership for his abusive treatment of them over their years in the Brotherhood.</p><p>Time would eventually heal their wounds, and they would come to a grudging acceptance of him. Magneto joins the X-Men after being persuaded to give human/mutant co-existence a chance by Professor Xavier. This comes at a time when Charles is badly injured in battle and Magneto takes over the reign of his school, teaching young mutants to control their powers and use them for the betterment of both humans and mutants. He started teaching the New Mutants and fought alongside the X-men. This, at first was very difficult for many of the team-members, since they had done battle against Magneto more then once.</p><p>However, Magneto proved to be a valuable ally and the X-Men started to trust him. Even <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>, previously extremely wary of the mutant leader, grew to accept him. It appeared Magneto was truly a changed man, and even allowed himself to be put on trial on France.

However, he was soon confronted by the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a>, who mistakenly believed him to be there for sinister purposes. Despite trying to explain himself, Magneto ended up fighting against the heroes, which only got worse when the X-Men arrived to back him up. The situation would grow even more complicated when the <a href=\"/soviet-super-soldiers/4060-26568/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26568\">Soviet Super Soldiers</a> joined the fray, seeking to arrest Magneto for a volcanic eruption he'd previously caused in Russia. The X-Men themselves were concerned by Magneto's actions, and Wolverine began to suspect that Erik might be returning to his old ways. After finding his old helmet in the ruins of Asteroid M, Magneto began to feel tempted by his past, believing that he could use the old mind control circuits within to brainwash the planet's population so that all feelings of bigotry would be erased. When asked his thoughts on the situation, <a href=\"/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a> argued that using mind control to change minds was unethical, and something that would violate the very concept of freedom Magneto was striving for. After realizing that there was no anti-mutant bigotry in Captain America's heart, Magneto surrendered himself to the Avengers and allowed himself to be put on trial once again. When <a href=\"/spectrum/4005-11337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Captain Marvel</a> discovered that the head judge presiding over the case was revealed to be an anti-mutant bigot, Magneto decided to use his helmet to alter the man's mind and remove his prejudiced thoughts. After finally destroying his helmet and being found innocent of his past crimes, a largely surprised Magneto now felt like a free man once more who had made a change for the good.</p><p>However, certain events would reverse a great many of those feelings soon. The <a href=\"../../mutant-massacre/39-41407/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mutant Massacre</a> occurred, in which many of the <a href=\"../../morlocks/65-3191/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Morlocks</a> would be killed by the mutant-hunting <a href=\"/marauders/4060-40480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40480\">Marauders</a>. Some months later, during the events of the Fall of the Mutants, Magneto's star pupils, <a href=\"/cypher/4005-14559/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14559\">Cypher</a>, was killed by a human. This incident and the fact that he could not have protected an innocent young mutant under his care, started breaking Magneto up. At this time, he also lost contact with the X-Men when the team went to Australia.</p><p>In finding security for his New Mutant students, Magneto went as far as joining longtime X-Men rivals the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a> in hope of providing the security for them that he could not give. The New Mutants, however, wanted nothing to do with Magneto anymore, feeling he had betrayed them. Magneto, now angry, left the New Mutants and, after this, many of his human-hating ways resurfaced. Ultimately, Magneto would view his role as leader of the X-Men and teacher of the New Mutants as a failure on his part and he retired to Asteroid M to live in seclusion.</p><h3>Mutant Separatism</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-75994\" data-ratio=\"1.4225\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.3%\" href=\"https://static6.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-75994\"><img alt=\"The Master of Magnetism \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-width=\"449\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Master of Magnetism \" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" data-width=\"449\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Master of Magnetism </figcaption></figure><p>While living in isolation, a group of mutants led by <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Fabian Cortez</a> calling themselves the <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Acolytes</a> approached Magneto asking for his leadership. Magneto decided that his best course of action would be to create a nation for mutants unto themselves and goes so far as declaring <a href=\"../../asteroid-m/34-41752/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Asteroid M</a> such a nation. Magneto even made the move to defend himself against further attacks of the human race by taking up the armed missiles of a Russian submarine he sunk years ago.</p><p>The X-Men responded accordingly by assaulting Magneto and his group of mutants. While the X-man <a href=\"/rogue/4005-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1446\">Rogue</a> tried to bring peace between the former allies, it ultimately had no effect and he attacked her without remorse. Magneto turned his back on the X-Men for good, feeling they had not only betrayed him in not trusting his judgement, but also betraying their friendship. The X-men then assaulted the asteroid, with Cortez’ betrayal leading to Magneto’s ultimate defeat. Magneto retreated to his back-up space station <a href=\"/avalon/4020-41283/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41283\">Avalon</a> where he grew even more bitter then before. Erik however soon encountered the X-men once again, during the X-Men’s siege on Avalon.</p><p>During this conflict, Magneto still held back against his former allies, until the X-Man Wolverine attacked him and almost gutted him. He then used his powers to rip the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton, almost killing him. An angered and furious Xavier lashed out, wiping Magneto's mind and leaving him in a catatonic state. The X-man Colossus turned sides on the X-men and helped Magneto out of Avalon and returned him to a rebuild Astroid M.</p><h3>Joseph</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142533\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.065\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-142533\"><img alt=\"Magneto versus his clone\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Magneto versus his clone\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/142533-81306-joseph.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-width=\"600\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Magneto versus his clone</figcaption></figure><p>For months, the catatonic Magneto sat on his thrown on Asteroid M, being served by his Acolytes, but not being able to even utter a word. This all changed when an \"Age of Apocalypse\" refugee named <a href=\"/holocaust/4005-15071/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15071\">Holocaust</a> entered the base and brought it down around them. Magneto was saved by Colossus and found himself alone again back on earth. It was then that a mutant teleporter named <a href=\"/astra/4005-46525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46525\">Astra</a>, as a way of revenge, restored Magneto's memories (by an unknown method) and created a clone named Joseph from his DNA. It was her plan to kill Magneto after that, but the clone went out of control and during this scene, Magneto managed to escape. For some months, it was thought that Jospeh was actually Magneto. The clone even became an ally to the X-men. It took a few more months before Magneto finally made himself known to the world once again.</p><p>Disguised as a normal human, Magneto placed the fate of humanity in the hands of an average man name William Jones. William was a building-contractor and was investigating a freakish building collapse of the Center for Humanitarian Excellence in Los Angeles, which was suspected to be the work of mutants. Magneto, posing as a board member, engaged William in conversation. The two had a pleasant conversation until Magneto showed him his powers and told him who he really was. William became afraid and told him in all honesty that he would like him to be gone from this world, not because he hated him, but because of his overwhelming power and what he did with it.</p><p>Having perverted his supposedly objective experiment in human nature to his own ends, Magneto thanked William and left him to meet his cadre of robots at the magnetic north pole, where he began to manipulate the Polar magnetic fields. Only if the United Nations would meat his demands, Magneto would stop destroying the Polar magnetic fields. Luckily, the X-men intervened and managed to defeat Magneto, with Magneto's clone Joseph dying in the process. His defeat was, however, not before the United Nations met his demands, giving Magneto his only island to rule, the nation of Genosha.</p><h3>Leader of Genosha</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1466054-72_magneto_1.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1466054-72_magneto_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1466054-72_magneto_1.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1466054-72_magneto_1.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Magneto was given full authority by the United Nation to become the leader of the Island nation of Genosha. A difficult task lay before him since the country was wrecked during the civil war between humans and mutants after the uprising of the former mutant slaves. Magneto however soon managed to establish a government and tried to bring order to the nation. Despite some difficulties, Magneto managed to pull it of. He even got help from his son and daughters, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Polaris, during this time. Genosha became a utopian nation for mutants where they could live in peace and freedom. Some months later however, Magneto kidnapped Charles Xavier in order to show him what he had achieved. A newly formed team of X-men managed to free Xavier, while Wolverine gutted Magneto badly and was left with serious injuries. Magneto however had full right to defend his nation from foreign diplomacy (being the X-men) and while Magneto was defeated in battle, he won the war when the X-men left the nation.</p><h3>Destruction of a Nation</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2150697-tri_sentinel.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2150697-tri_sentinel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2150697-tri_sentinel.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/109227/2150697-tri_sentinel.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Some weeks went by and Erik was healing from his last battle against the X-men. It was at this time that a full frontal Sentinel attack was undertaken on Genosha by the menace known as Cassandra Nova, who now had possession over the Sentinels, only after killing Bolivar Trask's nephew, Donald Trask and \"gaining\" his DNA. Magneto was seemingly one of the first to fall in battle. A giant airplane with the appearance of an iron fist entered the tower in witch Magneto was located. After this first attack, a huge Sentinel destroyed the entire city, leaving almost everyone dead in it's wake. When the X-men came to investigate they saw the slaughter of countless mutants. A true new dark age for the mutants had begun. While investigating, the X-men found a tape that was made by Magneto a few minutes prior to his seeming death. He told his nation to never give up and be strong, even in the darkest of times. It seemed that Erik Lenhsherr, Magneto, had finally perished in battle.</p><h3>Xorn and Excalibur</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78429\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/78429-161566-xorn.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2375\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:123.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/78429-161566-xorn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-78429\"><img alt=\"Xorn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px\" data-width=\"517\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Xorn\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px\" data-width=\"517\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xorn</figcaption></figure><p>After believing Magneto gone for good, the newest teacher at the Xavier Institute, the enigmatic, masked mutant known as <a href=\"/xorn/4005-3183/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3183\">Xorn</a>, revealed himself as Magneto in disguise to Professor Xavier. This \"Magneto\" told Charles he had been living under their noses the whole time. He quickly defeated the X-men and, along with several mutant-students he had been teaching the last months, staged an attack on the island of <a href=\"/manhattan/4020-57225/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57225\">Manhattan</a>. This included murdering numerous humans in crematoriums, mirroring his Holocaust persecution. The X-Men however doubted his legitimacy as the real \"Master of Magnetism\". The X-men regrouped and fought Xorn. His addiction to the power-enhancing drug named “ <a href=\"/kick/4015-42307/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-42307\">Kick</a>” however allowed Xorn to assault and kill <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> by giving her a planetary-scale stroke.

The real Magneto had never left the island of Genosha after the attacks on it by Cassandra Nova.</p><p>Eventually, Charles Xavier contacted Magneto and went to Genosha to figure out what Erik's next move should be. He was now the world's most hated man, even though it had not been him that attacked humankind this time. Magneto was furious to think that people would actually think him able to do those horrible acts. Magneto and Xavier remained on the island for a longer period of time, in the meantime finding other survivors of the Sentinels attacks. The two became close friends once more over the period of time and Magneto finally seemed to have forsaken his more violent ways. Things all changed when Charles and Erik saw a news broadcast that showed images of Erik's daughter, Wanda Maximoff (better known as the Scarlet Witch), to have suffered a nervous breakdown and hurt and killed many of her former Avengers teammates in the process. She had been taken into custody. Magneto donned his uniform once more and went straight to New York City, leaving Charles and his more peaceful life behind.</p><h3><a href=\"/house-of-m/4045-40991/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40991\">House of M</a></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93988\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6025\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:160.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-93988\"><img alt=\"House of Magnus\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg 399w\"><noscript><img alt=\"House of Magnus\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/77/93988-159329-magneto.jpg 399w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" data-width=\"399\"></noscript></a><figcaption>House of Magnus</figcaption></figure><p>After <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Wanda</a> devastatingly, but accidentally, disbanded the <a href=\"/avengers/4060-3806/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3806\">Avengers</a> and was rendered unconscious, Magneto appeared and demanded to have his daughter remanded to his care. The Avengers and the X-men at this point found out that Magneto was still alive and that he was not the one responsible for the attacks on New York City, which where actually Xorn's. The Avengers accepted a grieving father's demands and gave Wanda, somewhat reluctant, over to Magneto. Magneto then returned back with Wanda to the island of Genosha where he and Charles Xavier had spent their last months. Magneto watched over his sleeping daughter, kept unconscious by Xavier. However, both the X-men and the newly formed Avengers saw Wanda as a threat and where planing to bring Wanda in, or even have her killed should that be necessary. Magneto's son, <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Pietro</a> (Quicksilver) demanded that Magneto saved her. Magneto responded that it was out of his hands and there was nothing he could do. On the one hand Wanda was indeed his flesh and blood and he would give his life for her, but on the other hand, she clearly had a mental breakdown and was dangerous.</p><p>It was then that the combined forces of the X-Men and the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a> arrived on Magneto's doorstep. Before they could act however, the world flashed white and when it returned, reality had been remade as a world where mutants where the dominant species and humanity was on the decline. Magneto was now ruler over the sovereign nation of Genosha, the dominant superpower in the world, and mutants held almost all worldwide positions of power.</p><p>The world has been reversed: mutants now subjugate and legislate against humans, waiting for them to die out over the natural course of their existence.

The revelation came out that it was actually Pietro, not Erik, who convinced Wanda to remake the world in this image. As the world crumbled around them and returned to normal reality, Wanda utters three simple words: No more mutants. When everything returns to normal, 99% of the world’s mutant population has been depowered, including Magneto.

They no longer listened to Magneto, because he wasn't a mutant anymore. By teaming up, Magneto and Xavier managed to break free of the Acolytes and stop them from further pursuit. The two then went their separate ways again. Some months later, Magneto contacted the High Evolutionary, who managed to return Magneto's lost mutant powers. This all happened during a ruse where he attacked the X-Men once again.

Erik reveals to Wolverine's <a href=\"/x-force/4060-15595/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15595\">X-Force</a> that he is aware of their existence, and trades his silence for the murder of the Nazi officer. <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> takes the task on alone and completes it.</p><h3><a href=\"/schism/4045-56404/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56404\">Schism</a></h3><p>Magneto appears alongside <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor</a>, and <a href=\"/iceman/4005-1464/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1464\">Iceman</a> at the unveiling of a mutant museum in <a href=\"/san-francisco/4020-55704/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55704\">San Francisco</a> under orders from <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>. The highly publicized event is attacked by the new <a href=\"/hellfire-club/4060-13357/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13357\">Hellfire Club</a>. Each of the X-Men present are taken down one by one through technology specifically designed to defeat each of them. Magneto is shot with a miniaturized neutron star. The Hellfire Club then attaches brain slugs to the X-Men to keep them unconscious. <a href=\"/oya/4005-73388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73388\">Idie</a>, the only mutant left in the museum unscathed, kills the remaining Hellfire members to save everyone.</p><p>The Hellfire Club unleashes a giant <a href=\"/sentinel/4005-5281/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5281\">Sentinel</a>, charged with destroying <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/4020-41752/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41752\">Utopia</a>. Cyclops and some of the younger mutants prepare to stand their ground, while <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> demands that the children run and save themselves. The Sentinel winds up being defeated. However, the X-Men are split between Cyclops and Wolverine. Magneto remains loyal to Cyclops and stays on Utopia.</p><h3><a href=\"/regenesis/4045-56644/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56644\">Regenesis</a></h3><p>Magneto is later assigned to Cyclops' new \"Extinction Team\", which also consists of Namor, <a href=\"/danger/4005-40862/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40862\">Danger</a>, <a href=\"/magik/4005-8303/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8303\">Magik</a>, Colossus, <a href=\"/storm/4005-1444/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1444\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/hope-summers/4005-49329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49329\">Hope</a>, and Emma Frost. In a training exercise between the Extinction Team and Hope's <a href=\"/five-lights/4060-57893/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57893\">Lights</a>, Magneto is attacked by <a href=\"/zero/4005-73182/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-73182\">Zero</a> and reacts by brutally by ripping him in half with his magnetic powers. Zero is able to pull himself back together (which Magneto knew he was capable of doing), but Magneto is harshly reprimanded by Hope and Cyclops for attacking so harshly during a training exercise. After the apparent death of <a href=\"/jocasta/4005-3318/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3318\">Jocasta</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/4005-2247/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2247\">Hank Pym</a> calls for <a href=\"/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> and Magneto to aid him in his investigation. Upon their arrival to the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast-compound/4020-57042/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57042\">West Coast Academy</a>, Magneto agrees to assist so long as <a href=\"/quicksilver/4005-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1467\">Quicksilver</a> refrains from involving himself in any mutant affairs. He claims that Pietro coerced his sister into the events that led to her breakdown and cites his misuse of the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/4055-40921/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40921\">Terrigen Mists</a> and the war that was caused due to it.</p><p>Magneto is also faced with a ghost from his past in the form of his clone, <a href=\"/joseph/4005-15063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15063\">Joseph</a>. Disguised as Magneto, Joseph kills a group of anti-mutant protesters witch causes a conflict between Magneto and the authorities and the Avengers. The Avengers claim Magneto to be the perpetrator. However, Magneto soon found out that the mutant teleporter <a href=\"/astra/4005-46525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46525\">Astra</a>, an old nemesis to Magneto as well as the person who created the original Joseph, was to blame for the new Joseph and the murders.

Magneto's powers are broken due to a blast from the Phoenix Force, as well as the rest of the team's due to their exposure. With their broken abilities, the team have searched the planet for new mutants due to the re-igniting of the mutant gene. Magneto seemingly betrays the X-Men in order to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. and tell them what Cyclops' team is up to. He reveals himself to the rest of the X-Men that he did so in order to act as a double agent since the team is on the run. Magneto helps build the New Charles Xavier school from the remnants of an old Weapon X facility. He also helps in recruiting new mutants in a girl that can control time, a healer, a boy who can project golden balls, a chameleon like mutant, and even visits the Jean Grey Institute to recruit some of their students in the form of the Stepford Cuckoos, and the time-displaced Angel of the original X-Men. Magneto is now Limbo with the team to fight the threat of Dormammu and his demons. Magneto and the team hold out long enough for Magik to absorb Limbo, defeat Dormammu and cast them out back to their dimension. Scott confronts Magneto about his loyalties, but Magneto wants the end goal to be the same as Scott and the two have a conversation to further strengthen their relationship and come to terms with their standings in regards to each other. Magneto is there with the rest of the team when Emma is helping the new mutant David Bond, control his powers to show off what he can do. Magneto and the rest of the X-Men help rescue Fabio from S.H.I.E.L.D..</p><p>Magneto gets a message from Maria Hill so that they can meet up and talk. Hill tells Erik that if he wishes to continue talking with her he will have to talk to Dazzler, the new mutant liaison. Magneto ends up returning to the X-Men's hideout, where he watches a pro-mutant rally supporting Cyclops with the team. Magneto shows up late to help battle Blockbuster sentinel, and he delivers the final blow before the sentinel is called back by its master.</p><p>Magneto ponders his current situation and what his direction is. Mystique posing as Dazzler reveals herself to him and invites him to come to Madripoor. He finds that Madripoor has been made into a new safe haven for the mutants. He finds there is the drug kick being made, but he ends up meeting up with the Blob. Fred takes him to the skyscraper where Mystique is at with Sabretooth and the new Silver Samurai, where they have reformed the Brotherhood of Mutants. Erik snaps at what has happened, saying this isn't a dream but a nightmare. In his rage he attacks the team and ends up making the skyscraper collapse before riding away in a helicopter, heading off on his own.</p><h3>AXIS and Time Runs Out</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-null\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/4573201-mag2014021-cov-col-fa2b2.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/4573201-mag2014021-cov-col-fa2b2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-null\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/4573201-mag2014021-cov-col-fa2b2.jpg\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/4573201-mag2014021-cov-col-fa2b2.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Magneto again appears on the scene during the events of AXIS, in which the Red Skull had taken the brain and telepathic powers of the deceased Charles Xavier, one of Erik's oldest friends. In his quest for revenge against the Red Skull, Magneto found out that Red Skull had used his new powers to wreck havok among the world and even founded his own concentration camp for mutants on the island of Genosha, Magneto's former base. As many of the heroes whom apposed the Red Skull in the initial assault fell, Magneto sought out a group of relunctant villains whom helped him fight the Red Skull. Eventually, Magneto and the rest of the heroes and villains where succesfull in taking out the Red Skull, after which Magneto took his rightfull place in Genosha, helping out the mutants that had been captured by the Skull some weeks before.</p><p>Although Magneto started rebuilding Genosha, all seemed for nothing when the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/universal-incursion/4015-56188/\">Universal Incursion</a> started happening. The multiverse had began to unravel, as each time, two planet earth's from two different universes collided, ending both universes. While many of the Marvel heroes tried to stop these incursions, Magneto also did his best in stopping the incursions. He, as well as all other heroes however failed, and the Marvel universe was seemingly destroyed forever.</p><h3>Leading the X-Men</h3><p>After the events of Secret Wars, reality was brought back thanks to Doctor Doom and Reed Richards. We see that Magneto is now leading a team of X-Men consisting of Psylocke, M, and Sabretooth. They are trying to find a cure for the Terrigen Mist when they discover that someone is gunning for healers. The Dark riders are their opponents, but they appear to being controlled by a unknown source.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><h3>Physical Attributes</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'2\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 190 lbs.</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Bluish-grey</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Bald (formerly silver, originally black)</li><li><b>Distinguishing Features:</b> Appears to be a man in his physical prime, and roughly half his much greater chronological age, as a result of being rejuvenated by the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/4005-13346/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13346\">High Evolutionary</a></li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Publicly known</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer, <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a> rights activist; former would-be conqueror, sovereign ruler of <a href=\"/genosha/4020-40967/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-40967\">Genosha</a>, teacher of the <a href=\"/new-mutants/4060-15971/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15971\">New Mutants</a>, headmaster of <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/4020-41138/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41138\">Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters</a>, terrorist, secret agent, Nazi-hunter, volunteer hospital orderly, carpenter</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> German; formerly Genoshan</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Germany</li><li><b>Education:</b> Some public schooling, unspecified advanced training in genetic engineering and robotics</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Widower</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> <a href=\"/jakob-eisenhardt/4005-58084/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58084\">Jakob</a> and <a href=\"/edie-eisenhardt/4005-70787/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70787\">Edie Eisenhardt</a> (parents, deceased), <a href=\"/erich-eisenhardt/4005-58085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58085\">Erich Eisenhardt</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/ruth-eisenhardt/4005-58086/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58086\">Ruth Eisenhardt</a> (sister, deceased), <a href=\"/magda/4005-45372/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45372\">Magda Eisenhardt</a> (wife, deceased), <a href=\"/anya/4005-45373/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-45373\">Anya Eisenhardt</a> (daughter, deceased), <a href=\"/zaladane/4005-21948/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21948\">Zala Dane</a> (Zaladane, alleged daughter, presumed deceased), <a href=\"/polaris/4005-1473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1473\">Lorna Dane</a> (Polaris, daughter), <a href=\"/joseph/4005-15063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15063\">Joseph</a> (clone)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Powers</h3><h4>Magnetic Field Manipulation</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1028992\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4333333333333\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1028992\"><img alt=\"The Master of Magnetism\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 669w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 446w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Master of Magnetism\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 669w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33913/1028992-117_uncanny_x_men_521.jpg 446w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-width=\"446\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Master of Magnetism</figcaption></figure><p>Magneto's <a href=\"/mutant/4015-40656/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40656\">mutant</a> power gives him mastery over all forms of magnetism. He can perceive the magnetic forces of the Earth as well as the bio-electrical patterns of all living beings. He can draw on and use the magnetosphere of the planet, which extends far into space. Magneto can use his vast power to reshape even the most indestructible metals, including the <a href=\"../../adamantium/18-40759/\" rel=\"nofollow \">adamantium</a> in <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>'s skeleton. He's been shown controlling the most insignificant magnetic particles in both the atmosphere and in living beings, reversing their blood flow or ripping out any ferrous elements through their tissues.</p><p>Magneto can create electromagnetic fields strong enough to manipulate non-ferrous items, though he may be using anti-gravity fields to do this. He has demonstrated the ability to lift thousands of tons with his magnetic powers, although the greater he exerts himself the greater the physical and mental stress he undergoes. Magneto has the ability to increase his physical attributes by directing his magnetic powers inward. He has been seeing increasing his physical strength and durability, as well as his speed and reaction time.</p><p>Magneto can create powerful magnetic force fields for personal protection, project blasts of electricity or magnetic energy, and generate powerful electromagnetic pulses. He can also assemble complicated machines within seconds through the use of his powers. Although Magneto's primary power is the control over magnetism, he can also manipulate any form of energy from the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. It is more difficult for Magneto to manipulate other forms of energy, so he predominately only uses magnetism.</p><p>After his exposure to an attack from the Phoenix Force, Magneto's powers have been greatly reduced. He has shown limits in only being able to dismantle a few sentinels at a time, and has been forced to become more precise in his attacks, resulting in him using metallic objects as projectiles more frequently. Magneto has also shown he can overexert himself rather quickly, resulting in physical harm. Despite these limits, Magneto has still shown the ability to fly and use his powers in a precise and accurate manner. Recently, in a fit of rage, he made a skyscraper collapse. Perhaps this shows his powers are returning to their once former glory or that in cases of extreme emotion, his powers get stronger than their current state.</p><h3>Abilities</h3><h4>Mental Resistance</h4><p>Magneto has trained himself to defend his mind against even the strongest telepathic attacks. Due in part to his long history with <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a>, he possesses a great deal of knowledge in devising technology to block psychic assaults. Magneto's helmet greatly augments his already immense mental fortitude, and even without it he has been shown resisting the intrusion of immensely powerful psychics such as Xavier and <a href=\"/emma-frost/4005-1457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1457\">Emma Frost</a> (whose telepathy Magneto resisted even when she possessed the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a>, though with great effort).</p><h4>Genius-level Intellect</h4><p>Magneto is a genius with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially genetic mutation, particle physics, engineering, and robotics. His intellect has allowed him to create many advanced and complex machines, most of which are well beyond the scope contemporary science. He has engineered advanced robots, space stations, devices capable of nullifying mutant powers except for his own, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, and devices that block telepathy. He can create artificial living beings (such as <a href=\"/alpha-the-ultimate-mutant/4005-25737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25737\">Alpha the Ultimate Mutant</a>) and fully-grown adult clones, as well as mutate humans in order to give them superhuman powers.</p><h4>Master Combatant</h4><p>Magneto has some military training in hand-to-combat and is capable of holding his own in a fight, though he prefers the use of his mutant powers in most combat situations.

In honor to his friend´s memory, Erik decided to fight Apocalypse and his twisted plans. Magneto and the X-Men fought against the forces of Apocalypse who, without the interference of Xavier was able to take over North America. In the first mission as X-Men in Cape Citadel, Magneto´s daughter Wanda was killed provoking his misery and anger.

However, he eventually found peace when he married Rogue and had a son named Magnus. Magnus inherited his father's powers and was well on his way of becoming even more powerful that Magneto, until one day he disappeared. In truth, he was taken away from this reality by the Timebreakers and was placed in the new Exiles team. Magneto was sure that his son had just left home to start his own life until his burned corpse was sent back.

When his secret activities were discovered by the church, he, along with Wanda and Petros, were forced to flee to the New World to the colony of mutants he had secreted out of Europe. After he assisted in helping return Steve Rogers to the proper time stream, he left Wanda and Petros in Carlos Javier's care with the instruction that Carlos was not to tell them he was their father.

Here he was born Erik Lensherr. Erik killed his mother (his father's fate is unknown) when he found out that his mother was a project manager of the Weapon X program and had kept and tortured Wolverine, Erik freed Logan and then fought his way out. Magneto's mother had wanted to \"cure\" mutants, and her son. However, it has also been alluded to that he is from a very wealthy and well-connected family that he has parted ways with. His wife's name was Isabelle, and he is aware from the beginning of his familial relationship with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. It is also noted that he verbally mistreats them, hinting that he regards them as a living reminder of having an inter-species relationship. This version of Magneto is significantly darker and more cynical than the mainstream version, regarding all humans with utter and unwavering disdain and likening them to \"insects\".</p><p>An arrogant fantasist who gradually sank deeper and deeper into his self-proclaimed role as Mutant Messiah, Eric Lensherr eventually reinvented himself as Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood Of Mutants and a ruthless terrorist who is willing to kill hundreds in the name of mutant supremacy. On several occasions Magneto has attempted to implement unflinchingly genocidal plans on humanity. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream counterpart and has displayed enough power to defeat the Ultimates.</p><p>Additionally, he was the one to cripple Professor X. Before the end of their association, Xavier and Magneto shared a very intense intellectual friendship. Using his knowledge of technology and genetics, Magneto helped Xavier to create the Savage Land as a mutant utopia. He also created an artificial language called Epsilon-Omega, based on Esperanto and featuring its own script, for mutants to use in the Savage Land, as a rejection of human languages. They even have plays, poetry, and songs in this language.</p><h3>The Tomorrow People</h3><p>Magneto is the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants and they are based out of the Savage Lands. Magneto originally sends Wolverine to infiltrate the X-Men and kill Professor X. While with the X-Men, Wolverine joins them for an attack on the Brotherhood. Magneto appeals to them with his own ideals of mutant superiority. When they refuse, he dismisses the X-Men however Cyclops returns later after a fight with Professor X. Magneto asks Cyclops to address him as father when in front of Quicksilver and tells him that his daughter is attracted to him. He seems to like the idea of Wanda being with Scott.</p><p>Due to the US government spotting the Blackbird leaving when the X-Men rescued the president'said daughter, the government now knows the location of the Savage lands. They send all their remaining Sentinels after Magneto, but he takes control of them and rewires them to hunt humans. Cyclops has second thoughts about joining the Brotherhood and warns the X-Men that Magneto is on his way to Washington DC. Magneto is about to crush the President between two cars but is stopped in time by Professor X. Wolverine stabs him in the chest from behind and Quicksilver takes off his helmet. Professor X is able to take control of Erik's mind and turns him into a super magnet, seemingly killing.</p><h4>Return of the King</h4><p>After his defeat at the hands of the X-Men, he was brainwashed by Xavier. He lived a normal life thinking he was just a normal human until he is freed by the Brotherhood. After gaining his consciousness back, Magneto devises a plan to make the X-Men and the Ultimates fight each other. When coming into contact with the Ultimates, Magneto shoots his son, Quicksilver, in the kneecaps. He says that it is not for betraying hjm, but instead for working with the humans. He has a plan to reverse the earths magnetic poles and hires the mutant Forge to make a machine that will amplify his powers. Eventually the X-Men come together and defeat Magneto, where this time he is imprisoned by SHIELD.</p><h4>Magnetic North</h4><p>Magneto later devises a plan where he has Polaris framed and imprisoned with him. Forge builds a machine that can Mimic Magneto's and Polaris' powers and uses it to frame Polaris. During this time Mystique come to the prison and trades places with magneto. Forge uses the machine again later in to make it look like Mystique has Magneto's powers when fighting the X-Men where she is defeated and imprisoned in Magneto's place while he escapes.</p><h4>Ultimatum</h4><p>After the death of his daughter, Magneto uses a machine built by Forge to amplify his powers and reverse the magnetic poles. For some reason, this causes a great flood, killing millions. Magneto then kills his long time enemy, Charles Xavier. The X-Men and the Ultimate team up and defeat him. Magneto is killed when Cyclops decapitated him with his optic blast.</p><h3>Marvel Zombieverse (Earth-2149)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-700461\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/700461-magneto.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.8695652173913\" data-width=\"920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/700461-magneto.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-700461\"><img alt=\"Zombieverse Magneto\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 920w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zombieverse Magneto\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 920w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/bundles/phoenixsite/images/core/loose/img_broken.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zombieverse Magneto</figcaption></figure><p>When turning an asteroid away from the Earth, the Sentry had come in contact with a disease that turned normal people into flesh craving zombies.

Steve was always a courageous kid as well as a diligent student, but he wasn't very athletic and he was quiet and introverted, because he was so skinny. Although he would eventually grow to 6'2, he was scrawny and weak, always last in athletic games (much like one <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a>, that would be born much later). A target for bullies as he grew up, he was protected by his best friend <a href=\"/arnie-roth/4005-32774/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-32774\">Arnie Roth</a>, and, on at least one occasion, by neighborhood tough-guy <a href=\"/dominic-fortune/4005-28466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28466\">Duvid Fortunov</a>. Though it wasn't apparent at the time, he possessed fierce loyalty, a courageous fighting spirit and a noble heart. Knowing he had no future in athletics, Steve majored in fine arts and was an exceptionally talented artist specializing in illustration.</p><p>His life changed, though, when the Axis forces sweep across <a href=\"/europe/4020-56099/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56099\">Europe</a> starting World War II. Seeing their atrocities on newsreels, Rogers becomes convinced they need to be fought and that the European war would soon pull America into the conflict, inspiring him to enlist in the U.S. armed forces to fight against the Axis forces.</p><h3><strong>Becoming Captain America</strong></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1094306\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.846875\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1094306\"><img alt=\"Steve Rogers bombarded with Vita Rays.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Steve Rogers bombarded with Vita Rays.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/7666/1094306-steve6068.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Steve Rogers bombarded with Vita Rays.</figcaption></figure><p>When he tried to join the U.S. military Steve was immediately rejected due to him being physically too skinny and classified as \"4-F.\" Steve was puny and didn't even come close to passing the mandatory physical exam for induction, although he wanted with all his life to serve his country, he was rejected and stamped out. It seemed there was nothing he could do. He eventually made an impression on the Army recruiters and trainers, however, when he convinced them just how desperately he wanted to do his part, and how it was his dream to fight for America against the Axis powers. Steve caught the attention of an officer who was looking for men to volunteer as test subjects for an experimental program which was part of a top-secret defense plan known to only a dozen men or less. The experimental program was called Operation: Rebirth. The plan was to create physically superior soldiers with a new serum dubbed the Super-Soldier Formula. If it worked, it would make ordinary men into super soldiers. They would become perfect physical beings; possessing strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and recuperative powers that bordered near the upper limits of human evolutionary potential.</p><p>After a rigorous process to choose a suitable candidate, Steve Rogers was chosen to be the first man whom the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">Super Soldier Serum</a> would be administered to. It was <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/4005-43681/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43681\">Dr. Abraham Erskine</a> who had developed the process, and it was he who administered it to Rogers. Rogers was injected with the Super Soldier Serum and was then bathed in Vita-Rays which activated and stabilized the serum's chemicals in his system.</p><p>The process worked perfectly; Steve Rogers' entire physical being was boosted to the maximum of human potential and efficiency. In addition, he virtually doubled in size as millions of new cells were created almost instantaneously. His muscle strength, flexibility and reflexes improved to the peak of human potential. Steve marveled, he had become the ultimate specimen of human physical power and ability as all weakness and deficiencies drained from his body. Just then, a Nazi spy burst in with a gun. He cried \"Hail Hitler\" and shot Erskine through the head. In order to keep Nazi spies from obtaining it, Erskine hadn't written down the serum's ingredients, along with much of the procedure, having instead committed it to memory. Therefore the secret of the Super Soldier Serum died with him. Steve Rogers would be the only Super-Soldier. He chased after and caught the Nazi spy who'd assassinated Erskine and broke his neck, killing him. He then vowed to use his power to fight the enemies of America and become a symbol of freedom.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-113775\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.07\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-113775\"><img alt=\"Captain America &amp; Bucky\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain America &amp; Bucky\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/113775-104886-winter-soldier.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain America &amp; Bucky</figcaption></figure><p>The U.S. government, disappointed at the loss of their planned super soldier army was determined to use Rogers to his fullest potential. To this end, they decided to use him as a superhero to fight the Nazis; to become a symbol of freedom and hope against Nazi forces as well as a counter-intelligence agent. He also would be their answer to and main weapon against the leader of the Nazi terrorist operations - the <a href=\"/red-skull/4005-2250/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2250\">Red Skull</a>. The U.S. Government gave him a costume based on the American flag, an unbreakable shield (given to him by <a href=\"/franklin-d-roosevelt/4005-31595/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-31595\">President Franklin Roosevelt</a>), a sidearm, and the name Captain America. From that point on, Steve Rogers was Captain America. A short time later he was stationed on an army base in Virginia serving as Private Steve Rogers.</p><p>While there he continued his extensive training and was deployed several times both domestically and abroad on covert missions. When on base as private, Steve purposely developed a persona and reputation as a clumsy soon-to-be soldier. It was also during this period that he meets <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky Barnes</a> - a young teenager who accidentally found out that Steve Rogers was secretly Captain America.

The Invaders were featured in a comic book of their own in the 1970s. Recently, it has been stated that Bucky was already being trained when Steve/Captain America met him at the military base, hence, his being able to fight side-by-side with Cap almost immediately despite not having any super-powers.</p><p>During a mission to the African nation of <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a>, Cap met King <a href=\"/tchaka/4005-62659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62659\">T'Chaka</a>, the then-current Black Panther (this was later retconned into being<a href=\"/azzari-the-wise/4005-69986/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69986\"> Azzari</a>, T'Chaka's father).

In return, Cap gave the Panther his original, triangular shield, which would be held on display in Wakanda for decades to come.</p><p>A few years passed, and, in part due to Captain America and the Invaders' contributions, by 1945 the war was drawing to an end in Europe with the Allies driving the Axis troops out of the countries they had occupied.</p><p>With the Nazis retreating Cap and Bucky were on a routine mission trying to stop the evil <a href=\"/baron-heinrich-zemo/4005-3708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3708\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a> from harming civilians using an unmanned drone plane. The patriotic duo engaged Zemo and his troops but before he was could be stopped Zemo managed to launch the drone plane up into the air towards allied forces armed with a huge bomb. Racing towards the plane as it was about to launch, Captain America and Bucky managed to jump onto it so they could try to defuse the bomb. Cap realized they couldn't defuse it in time and tried to get Bucky, who was closer to the bomb, to jump off. Tragically, the bomb exploded and seemingly killed Bucky while throwing Captain America into the freezing waters of the North <a href=\"/atlantic-ocean/4020-56201/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56201\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. All searches to rescue or recover them failed and both were eventually presumed dead.

Unfortunately this Captain America's tour of duty ended when Adam II (an android) killed him in 1946.</p><p>The U.S. Government still felt having a \"Captain America\" was necessary so they again recruited one. This next replacement Captain America was the <a href=\"/patriot/4005-44588/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44588\">Patriot</a>, Jeff Mace, another Golden Age/World War II superhero. This Captain America also had a partner code-named \"Bucky\" but, unfortunately, two years into their stint this \"Bucky\" was shot in the legs, sustaining injuries that prohibited him from being Bucky any longer. Yet another former super-hero, this time the female, <a href=\"/golden-girl/4005-34752/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34752\">Golden Girl</a>, became Cap's crime-fighting, commie-busting partner until they both quit to marry each other. Determining that replacing Captain America and Bucky properly was quite difficult as well as risky to his iconic reputation, the U.S. Government finally let the idea fade and there was no Captain America and no Bucky.</p><h3><b>1950's Commie-Bustin' Cap</b></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903896\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.97954545454545\" data-width=\"440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1903896\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg 440w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg 440w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/101073/1903896-burnside2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the 1950s, there was a brief run of the Captain America comic where, in keeping with the spirit of the times and the newly started 'Cold War' with communist <a href=\"/russia/4020-55706/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55706\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China</a>, Captain America becomes a more aggressive, conservative, communist-fighting character. When the real Captain America made his return in the '60s, the appearance of the '50s Cap was left unexplained, until <a href=\"/steve-englehart/4040-42211/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42211\">Steve Englehart</a> started on the book.</p><p>In 1953, a man named <a href=\"/grand-director/4005-14492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14492\">William Burnside</a> found the lost formula for the Super-Soldier Serum in Nazi files in a <a href=\"/germany/4020-55777/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55777\">German</a> warehouse. This man idolized and almost worshiped Captain America. He had a Ph.D. in American History and he had done his thesis on Captain America. He immediately tells the government about the formula in exchange for becoming the next Captain America. He underwent plastic surgery to look like Steve Rogers and was set to be the symbol for the Korean War. However, the project was never finished, so \"Steve Rogers\" became a teacher.</p><p>While teaching, he finds a young student named <a href=\"/jack-monroe/4005-7618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7618\">Jack Monroe</a> (eventually known as <a href=\"/jack-monroe/4005-7618/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7618\">Nomad</a>) who also is a huge Captain America fan. They use the formula on themselves and became the new Captain America and Bucky. They fight Communism, but they didn't know of the Vita-Ray process that was required to stabilize the recipient after taking the super-soldier formula. Since they don't take it, it affected their minds and they became overly paranoid, attacking anyone they even have the slightest suspicion of being a Communist, seeing threats to America where none existed. The government quickly realized they were out of control, and shut them down, placing them in suspended animation. Years later they are freed by a disgruntled government employee. Newly awakened in the 1970's, they confront the real Captain America and his new partner, the <a href=\"/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon</a>.</p><p>Regarding the differences that underpinned this confrontation, Steve says, \"In this case, the comics mirrored their eras; the late '30s-early '40s Cap was a liberal and the early '50s Cap was a conservative. The first one looked up to Roosevelt; the second looked up to McCarthy. That's about as fundamental as it gets.\" Thus, it was not only a physical battle, but a battle of ideologies in which Cap confronted the impostor with just how out of touch and extreme he has become, and in doing so, manages to defeat him.</p><h3><b>The Modern Age</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-297055\" data-ratio=\"0.4575\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:45.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-297055\"><img alt=\"Discovery.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Discovery.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11352/297055-82745-avengers.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Discovery.</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, it was Cap's former Invaders teammate, <a href=\"/namor/4005-1476/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1476\">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>, who finds an Inuit tribe worshiping a frozen figure in a block of ice near the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Namor, seemingly enraged that they are worshiping an inanimate object, lifts the block of ice and hurls it into the sea. Apparently damaged by the impact of hitting the water, the ice began breaking apart revealing the frozen figure within as a man.

The Avengers determined he was still alive and they revived him. Upon becoming conscious, Captain America didn't recognize any of the Avengers so he assumed they were Nazis and immediately sprung into action battling the entire team alone.

Recognizing his value as a skilled fighter in combat, a great tactician, and a natural leader; the Avengers invite Captain America to join their team. The Living Legend of World War II accepted, and soon became team leader, a position he has held more times than anybody else. This was quickly followed by his own monthly gig in the <a href=\"/tales-of-suspense/4050-2007/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2007\">Tales of Suspense</a> anthology, wherein he shared equal billing with Iron Man.

The Red Skull had kidnapped several of Cap's closest allies, including the Falcon, and forced Captain America to revert to his natural age by subjecting him to the same artificial aging process that he had used to advance his own daughter's age. The two had one final battle where they would fight as equals. Cap came out the victor but refused to kill the Red Skull, who died right after the battle of an apparent heart attack.

During a raid on a warehouse, a drug dealer blows the building up and Captain America finds himself caught in the fumes of Ice. Captain America finds himself hooked on the drug which makes him prone to violence and causes outbursts of rage. Caught in the middle of a turf war between The Kingpin and The Red Skull, Captain America's condition worsens until he subdued by Diamondback and The Black Widow. Captain America undergoes a blood transfusion to cleanse his blood of the drug; he is however temporarily stripped of the super-soldier serum. Vowing to break the drug circle, Captain America heads to Yankee Stadium where a final confrontation between the Red Skull and Kingpin occurs to determine who would control drug trafficking in New York. At the stadium Captain America is confronted by Crossbones, after a brutal fight Steve Rogers prevailed proving that even without the super-soldier serum, he could still be Captain America.</p><p>However disaster strikes when Captain America avoids an explosion at a drug lab full of a chemical that causes a reaction with the Super-Soldier serum in his system. It alters his biochemistry, and he begins to deteriorate. He turns to Iron Man, who helps him by making a powered exoskeleton for him in the vein of the Iron Man armor.

Barbaric medical practices are performed on the subjects. The surviving seven were sent forward to Europe, one of their number dying on the boat ride to complications with the serum. The remaining six entered the war in July 1942.</p><p>Bradley's only known costumed mission involved the destruction of the Nazi Super Soldier Project at Schwarzebitte, Germany in October 1942. Bradley steals a spare Captain America costume that had been set aside for Steve Rogers who was to lead the mission. He completed his mission, however he is captured and later interrogated by Hitler himself before being shipped off to Auschwitz. Bradley escaped and is taken in by the German and Belgian Underground Resistance. He is eventually able to sneak back behind Allied lines in 1943, but receives a court-martial from the Army and a sentence to life imprisonment for stealing Captain America's costume. Bradley served seventeen years and was released by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the day of President <a href=\"/john-f-kennedy/4005-33077/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33077\">John F.

Eventually, however, the serum's long-term effects damaged Isaiah Bradley, in his body and mind. He became childlike and began to disappear as a hero. It was then that he is discovered by Steve Rogers, who tracks him down and acknowledges his sacrifices and heroism. Isaiah Bradley remains as one of Cap's greatest allies - the black Captain America.

For a few months, there were no Avengers in the immediate vicinity. However, Captain America soon found himself in a situation that brought together many of New York's superheroes once again. Finding that destiny has struck twice, Captain America formed the New Avengers with Iron Man. Filling out the roster were newcomers Sentry and Ronin as well as high-profile superheroes such as <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, Wolverine and <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a>.

In the wake of this horrible tragedy, the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/4015-40639/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40639\">Super-human Registration Act</a> is quickly passed. This new law requires every superhuman in the United States to register with the federal government, submit to evaluation, training and even become a government operative. Some heroes are for it while some were against it. Captain America is the most highly-respected hero against it. He believes it infringes on the rights and personal freedoms of super-humans.</p><p>He elects to lead the anti-registration faction of heroes against the pro-registration people, who are led by none other than his friend and fellow Avenger; Iron Man. Cap and the other heroes' refusal to register immediately makes them all technically criminals and fugitives to be hunted down by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, police, their former friends, and even enemies/villains who'd registered and agreed to work as government operatives. The two factions clash several times with Iron Man beating Cap savagely in their first fight. However, as the War goes on, Cap's side grows by recruiting and attracting mostly street-level heroes like <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, and later <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> (after he defects from Iron Man's pro-registration side). Captain America's faction even recruits one true powerhouse; <a href=\"/hercules/4005-2503/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2503\">Hercules</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Cap's anti-registration faction gained enough strength to match Iron Man's pro-registration forces. Captain's morals were sorely tested too, when he enlisted the help of many figures he would normally apprehend and turn over to the authorities. The most notable of these questionable allies were Frank Castle, a.k.a. the <a href=\"/punisher/4005-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1525\">Punisher</a> and Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. the <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">Kingpin</a>.</p><p>Eventually events lead to the final confrontation between the opposing factions where Captain America confronted and batters Iron Man. The tide of the battle was turning in favor of Captain America's forces and victory was at hand when a group of ordinary civilians intervenes and attempt to restrain Cap. It was at this moment that Captain America realizes he was endangering the very people he had sworn to protect. \"We're not fighting for the people anymore. We're just...fighting.\" he said tearfully, surrendering even as he was about to win. Captain America then removed his mask, surrendered to authorities as Steve Rogers, and orders the anti-registration forces to stand down. As Rogers is led away in handcuffs, the Punisher retrieves Captain America's discarded mask. The majority of the other anti-registration heroes subsequently elect to register, while some decide to take their chances, stay outside the law and remain fugitives. After his arrest, Captain America is incarcerated by the federal government to await trial. The Civil War strains relationships between the former Avengers, too. <a href=\"/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> was dead.

It is later revealed that Steve Rogers is not dead. When S.H.I.E.L.D. and Tony Stark take possession of Captain America's body, and they wanted to conduct tests because he was the only perfect Super-Soldier. What they discover was the serum seems to have reversed the effects on his body after he died. Though his death demoralized even those he had fought against, the new order of superheroes had already begun, spearheaded by Iron Man, who had been appointed as the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the launch of the Fifty State <a href=\"/the-initiative/4060-42781/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42781\">Initiative</a> program, Iron Man's dream of a dedicated superhero team in each U. S. state was being realized. Little did he suspect that the mounting Skrull invasion was secretly placing one of their agents on each of those teams. In Captain America: New Deal, Steve Rogers left instructions for Tony Stark in a letter written before his death to \"save\" Bucky and that the mantle of Captain America should go on.</p><p>When the Winter Soldier (Bucky) is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, he managed to escape, only to attack Iron Man. The two fight to a standstill until Stark mentions the letter from Steve. Bucky isn't sure that Cap had meant for him to actually become Captain America. Tony said that there's no way Bucky would let anyone else fill those boots and asked if he wanted to be the one to let Steve down. Bucky says he'd do it under two conditions. The first was that his mind would be completely probed to ensure there was no trace of brainwashing or fail-safe code-words leftover from when he was under control as the Winter Soldier. The second condition is that he doesn't have to answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. or to Stark, just as Steve didn't. Tony thought about it and agreed. The Norse god Thor later communicates with the spirit of Steve Rogers on the one-year anniversary of his death.</p><h3><strong>Captain America Reborn</strong></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1072303\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.327239488117\" data-width=\"547\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 547px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:132.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1072303\"><img alt=\"Reborn: Cap comes back!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg 547w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg 482w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Reborn: Cap comes back!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg 547w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35374/1072303-reborn.jpg 482w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" data-width=\"482\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Reborn: Cap comes back!</figcaption></figure><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/captain-america-reborn/4045-56014/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56014\">Captain America Reborn</a></p><p>As the machinations of the Red Skull continue despite the intervention of the new Captain America, <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a> and the Falcon, he and <a href=\"/arnim-zola/4005-14876/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14876\">Arnim Zola</a> reveal to an astonished <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Norman Osborn</a> that the gun <a href=\"/sharon-carter/4005-38227/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38227\">Sharon Carter</a> used to kill Steve Rogers actually froze him in space and time at the moment of his death. That moment of spatial and temporal stasis could be used to bring back his body from any moment in the future via a modified version of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Dr. Doom's</a> time device and Sharon Carter herself, whom they referred to as \"the constant.\" At the time of the intended retrieval, Sharon's actions disrupted the process, resulting in Steve being lost in time and space. He is shown reliving moments of his past, most notably, events during the Second World War, badly disoriented and bewildered. While going through the time stream, Steve finds himself back in 1944, at one of the Red Skull's bases, fighting Master Man. As he begins to fight Master Man, Cap figures out that he has somehow been sent back in time and reliving all of the battles he has fought in over the years. After he defeats Master Man, Steve is then sent to the time he met with President Franklin Roosevelt at the <a href=\"/white-house/4020-56318/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56318\">White House</a>.</p><p>Back in the present, Bucky and Black Widow begin to fight <a href=\"/ares/4005-11940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11940\">Ares</a> and <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Venom</a> inside a <a href=\"/hammer/4060-56065/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56065\">H.A.M.M.E.R</a>.

While Reed does this, Hank mentions that Falcon and the Vision are out looking for Bucky and Black Widow, since they never returned from their mission. Reed then tells Hank that he has found something in Sharon's bloodstream, Reed then mentions that there was something similar to what's in Sharon's blood, in Steve's body that Reed had found after he had done an autopsy on it. Reed then tells Hank that there was something Tony Stark didn't like about the rapid cellular decay in Steve's body.</p><p>Norman then meets with <a href=\"/crossbones/4005-3225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3225\">Crossbones</a> and <a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\">Sin</a>, telling them that he knows about the second shooter and that he would love to have a Captain America on his side, leading his Avengers, even if the Red Skull's mind was in that Captain America's body.</p><p>Back in the past, Steve finds himself back in 1940 with Dr. Erskine, Steve then begins to ask the doctor about time travel and what would happen if someone were to go back and kill Hitler before all of this madness began. Dr. Erskine then tells Steve that doing something like that would have both an action and reaction that could end up making it so that your loved ones might have never been born. After this, Steve is taken into a lab and is about to relive the moment he became Captain America, Steve knows that the doctor is going to be killed by a Nazi spy, but is forced to do nothing but go through with the experiment. After he does, the doctor is killed and Steve begins to ask himself why he is reliving all of his past memories.</p><p>Back at the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, Norman is talking to the now captured Bucky and Black Widow, Norman then reveals that he had told the whole world that Sharon Carter was the second shooter in the assassination of Captain America and is now the world's most wanted. Norman then tells them that he is letting Black Widow go so that she could tell Sharon that if she doesn't turn herself in within twenty-four hours, Norman will kill Bucky.</p><p>Still trapped in time, Steve relives the time he was trapped in the ice, he begins to wonder why he even keeps track of the time anymore, since he believes time has no meaning for him now. As he ponders on this, Namor appears, as Steve knew he would, picking up the large chunk of ice that holds Steve. Everything happens like it always did, Namor throws the piece of ice into the water, even though Steve tries to yell Namor's name, to where Steve would be found by the Avengers. Back in the present, Reed Richards has met with Namor in the Arctic Ocean, where Steve's body was secretly laid to rest. Reed asks Namor to raise Steve's coffin, which Namor had already done, and as Reed examines Steve's body, the body disappears, shocking both Reed and Namor. As Reed tried to figure out what happened, he gets a call from Hank Pym, who tells Reed that Norman Osborn has outed Sharon Carter as the second shooter who killed Captain America, and to Black Widow's disapproval, Sharon tells them that she's going to turn herself in.</p><p>Elsewhere, Bucky is being transported by Norman's Thunderbolts, while Sharon tries to figure out what she should do. Back in time, Steve finds himself reliving his time during the <a href=\"/kree-skrull-war/4045-55742/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55742\">Kree-Skrull War</a>, fighting alongside <a href=\"/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Clint Barton</a>, who was going by Goliath at the time, fighting off an army of <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull</a> soldiers. Steve watches Iron Man, Thor, and <a href=\"/captain-marvel/4005-1472/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1472\">Captain Marvel</a>, Steve then asks the Vision, who had asked him to meet with the other Avengers on the command deck, if the Vision could remember something and then store it deep in his memory storage, something Vision said he would have no problem doing. Back with Bucky, Falcon attacks the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/4060-23977/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-23977\">Thunderbolts'</a> jet, fighting off the Thunderbolts, while the Thunderbolts' Ant-Man frees Bucky, after that Bucky and Falcon escape unharmed.</p><p>Still jumping through time, Steve finds himself reliving the time he and Rick Jones, who was going by the name of Bucky at the time, fight off a group of <a href=\"/hydra/4060-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3480\">HYDRA</a> agents. Steve then feels remorse for losing the original Bucky, his close friend James Barnes, when he almost calls Rick \"Bucky\". Back in the present, Norman Osborn has announced that Sharon Carter, Steve's lover, was the second shooter in his death. While he does this, Sharon is being taken to <a href=\"/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a>. At the <a href=\"/infinite-avengers-mansion/4020-56336/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56336\">Infinite Avengers Mansion</a>, Hank Pym and Mr. Fantastic activate the message Steve left with the Vision back during the Kree-Skrull War, telling them that he is lost in time.</p><p>Elsewhere, Bucky, Black Widow, and Clint Barton (Ronin), attack a H.A.M.M.E.R. mobile data-collector, trying to find out where Sharon Carter is. Once in Latveria, Sharon is shocked to see that the Red Skull is alive still, and is with Dr. Doom. They quickly then attach her to a machine that will bring Steve back to the present. In the English Channel Islands, 1945, Steve finds himself and Bucky escaping Baron Zemo's fortress. Bucky and Steve then jump onto the drone bomber that will explode, sending them to their apparent deaths, only to let them live to become who they are today. Steve, who has relived this day so many times in his mind, and nightmares, decides that he won't let Bucky get blown up again and become the Winter Soldier. As he tries to stop Bucky, Steve is suddenly pulled back through time, he then finds himself being attacked by the Red Skull as he flies through time.</p><p>Steve's body then appears in Dr. Doom's lab, but as Sharon calls out to him, it is revealed that the Red Skull has placed his mind in Steve's body, and is now in control of Captain America.

The A.I.M. ship takes out the Quinjet, causing it to crash in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>The Avengers are forced to fight the Skull's forces. While that happens, Steve finds where the Skull is hiding in his mind, and they begin to fight over control of Steve's body. Meanwhile, Bucky fights the Red Skull outside of Steve's body. But Bucky shows that he can't kill Steve, even if it is the Red Skull controlling him. . The Red Skull then takes Bucky's shield, stating that “what's Captain America without his shield?” He then cuts off Bucky's bionic hand, saying that it's time for a new morning in America. But before Red Skull can kill Bucky, Steve is able to force the Skull out of his mind and back into his robotic body, gaining control over his body again, and finally returning to the world he left.</p><p>Sharon Carter then uses one of Hank Pym's size changer devices to make the Red Skull into a giant, making sure he can't escape this time, Steve and Bucky then team up with the rest of the Avengers, fighting the giant Red Skull, and finally are able to seemingly kill the Red Skull. As they do so, the public sees Steve among the heroes, and yell with joy as they see that Captain America has returned. Back in <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>, Steve remembers that he saw the future while he was going through time, and that he believes Bucky is going to die, but before he can think about it more, Sharon comes to get him to come down to his party. Four days after his return, Steve had been training with Bucky, getting back into shape. He talks to Sharon, telling her how he's worried that he may slip away back into time again, she then tells him that he's not going anywhere and that she has him.</p><p>Later that night, Steve decides to suit up and go out into the city, to see what has changed. He finds Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow as they fight the Hyde who has escaped from The Raft. As Hyde tries to escape from the battle, Bucky sees Steve watching from the sidelines and throws him his shield, allowing him to defeat Hyde all by himself. Steve then says that was fun and hands Bucky the shield, but Bucky refuses to tell Steve that he's Captain America and that's his shield.</p><p>Steve then tells Bucky that they need to talk. Steve tells Bucky that he should keep being Captain America, that it means something more to him, which Bucky disagrees with, saying that Steve is the only Captain America. Steve then tells him that he's not sure if he's ready or will ever be able to pick up his shield again, and asks Bucky to continue being Captain America, if not for himself, then for him.</p><p>Steve then returns to Sharon, telling her that he believes that if Bucky doesn't continue to be Captain America, that he may die, and Steve could never live with that possibility, even if it means giving up the future he wants. Steve then meets with <a href=\"/barack-obama/4005-56661/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56661\">President Obama</a>, who gives Steve a Presidential Pardon for what he did during the Civil War, saying that he felt the S.H.R.A. was un-American to him.

Following the apparent death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America outfit. When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents Captain with his reforged shield now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow are the only ones who know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier.</p><h3><strong>Spider-Island</strong></h3><p>During the events of Spider-Island, Steve Rogers is captured by the Jackal when he was investigating in the former location of Project Rebirth. The Jackal mutates Steve into a giant spider creature, which he calls Spider King. The Jackal then impregnates him with thousands of spider eggs, so that the Spider King could spread the virus to other areas in the world. The Spider King was stopped by <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Agent Venom</a> but escaped capture when some of the eggs he was carrying hatched. He was re-captured and put into suspended animation. Agent Venom disguised himself as Spider King, in order to infiltrate the Jackal's secret base. Steve was given a cure and was reverted back to himself. He joined Agent Venom in the fight against The Queen, who was the secret person behind Spider-Island. Steve rallies the other Avengers, X- Men and other heroes to stand and fight against the large army to give Spider-Man a chance to cure the infected people.</p><h3><strong>Avengers vs. X-Men</strong></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724567\" data-ratio=\"0.615\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.5%\" href=\"https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724567\"><img alt=\"Leader of the X-Men vs. Leader of the Avengers!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Leader of the X-Men vs. Leader of the Avengers!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724567-5771792821-13365.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Leader of the X-Men vs. Leader of the Avengers!</figcaption></figure><p>When Steve learns that the Phoenix Force is coming for Hope and learns that Cyclops is ready to take the risk and will allow the Force to come to Hope, he right away takes the Avengers to Utopia to tell Scott that that is too risky and they cannot take such a big risk.

With his reputation tarnished by the actions of his doppelgänger, Steve finds that some citizens now fear him, having come to associate him with hatred and tyranny. After Sam returns from a time-traveling adventure that changes his perception of things, he voluntarily returns the shield and Captain America identity to Steve, reasoning that Steve will need them to overcome his current anguish and doubt. Donning his original costume, Steve embarks on a motorcycle journey across America, hoping to reconnect with the country. Along the way, he battles foes like <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a> and a new Swordsman, as well as a paramilitary group known as the Rampart. Following the battle with Kraven, Steve is frozen in ice by agents of the Rampart.</p><p>He awakens in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic 2025, where much of America lies in ruins after the Rampart launched a nuclear strike that decimated the nation. After linking up with a band of survivors led by a woman named <a href=\"/liang/4005-146355/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-146355\">Liang</a>, Cap sets out to topple the regime of King Babbington, the tyrannical ruler of America. After successfully beating Babbington, Cap is sent back to the present, where he avoids being frozen this time and defeats the Rampart before they can launch the nukes.</p><h3>Captain of Nothing</h3><p>Captain America was struggling to live down the behavior of Hydra-Cap in a divided country. His government gave pardons to criminals who helped resist the Secret Empire, including <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/4005-3457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3457\">Thunderbolt Ross</a>, recently incarcerated for desertion as Red Hulk.

Unfortunately, laying low wasn’t an option for Cap. When he saw the guards step out of line, he defended his fellow inmates. This built enough trust that when the <a href=\"/the-daughters-of-liberty/4060-64024/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-64024\">Daughters of Liberty</a> (secretly led by a resurrected Peggy Carter) attempted to break Cap out, the supervillains pitched in to help.</p><p>Now a fugitive, Cap casts off his Captain America uniform and asks the Daughters for help. He needs a team to investigate Ross’ murder and take on the growing number of domestic terrorists, like The Watchdogs. This forced Cap to cross paths with a new <a href=\"/scourge/4005-14461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14461\">Scourge</a>. Scourge was taking out Watchdogs hiding in the NYPD, inspiring violence across the city. Cap disapproved and tracked this new Scourge down, only to find him, dead by suicide.</p><p>The Daughters revealed at the center of the conspiracy against Captain America was <a href=\"/alexa-lukin/4005-151846/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-151846\">Alexa Lukin</a>, the wife of an old villain of Cap’s. She was working with the mutant, <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a>. Selene had stolen a piece of Sharon’s soul during her investigations, so Cap teamed up with his old pals, Bucky and Falcon to get it back. Their cover was blown, and they were, ultimately, rescued by the Daughter of Liberty. With the backup, they were able to recover Sharon’s soul piece, returning Sharon to her youthful appearance.</p><p>Their victory celebration was cut short when other Daughters members were caught by Lukin’s forces in <a href=\"/madripoor/4020-42665/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-42665\">Madripoor</a>, where the Daughters found Ross alive. Cap and his friends fought through Watchdogs to Alexa and Red Skull, resurrected in Alexa’s husband’s body. Luckily, they were able to escape with the help of Ross’ Red Hulk form, leading to an exoneration for Cap.</p><p>However, it wasn’t enough. Lukin had already fomented enough rage and distrust across the country that multiple political demonstrations ended in violence. This was the plan all along. The Red Skull had used social media to reach the masses and brainwash followers. It was an enemy Cap couldn't punch, so he riled up Red Skull into monologuing how he really feels about his followers. Using a spy cam, the Daughters were able to broadcast it on his own channel.</p><h3>United States of Captain America</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8206073\" data-ratio=\"1.538\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8206073\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8206073-united_states_of_captain_america_vol_1_5.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After Cap's shield was stolen by an imposter Captain America (mind-controlled <a href=\"/speed-demon/4005-2128/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2128\">Speed Demon</a>), Cap and Falcon tracked him to a railroad bridge. There, he used the shield to derail a train as a distraction. While Cap helped passengers escape the wreck, he mistook a helper inspired by Cap as the imposter. This helper was <a href=\"/aaron-fischer/4005-170473/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-170473\">Aaron Fischer</a>, a gay runaway who informed Cap of the <a href=\"/captains-network/4060-65079/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65079\">Network of Captain Americas</a>, do-gooders from across the country inspired by Cap. When a second masked stranger (<a href=\"/sin/4005-28057/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28057\">Sin</a>) tried to assassinate Aaron at the scene, Cap believed the rest of the network could be a target.</p><p>So, Sam agreed to hit the road with Cap protecting these would-be heroes. Their first stop was Harrisburg, PA, where <a href=\"/nichelle-wright/4005-171290/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-171290\">Nichelle Wright</a> was being framed by Sin for destroying a new water pipe that she helped get installed.

Together, they protected a Native American candidate for governor from Speed Demon.</p><p>Upon learning that the imposter Caps had moved on to NORAD where they planned on releasing the Hate-Monger with their boss, <a href=\"/warrior-woman/4005-28406/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-28406\">Commander Krieger</a>, Cap called as many hands on deck as he could, including US Agent. Cap with 5 of his proteges take on the imposters but manage to lose Krieger, who escaped with Hate-Monger.</p><p>Eventually, they tracked Hate-Monger to a broadcast intended to mesmerize the country. Unfortunately, it was a trap that he, Falcon, and US Agent got caught in. Krieger attempted to mesmerize Cap before the broadcast, but Bucky broke in, leading a many members of the Network. Together, they were able to stop Hate-Monger.</p><h3>Judgment Day</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8661480\" data-ratio=\"1.4514889529299\" data-width=\"1041\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1041px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.1%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8661480\"><img alt=\"Resurrected by The Five\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 1041w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 661w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 440w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Resurrected by The Five\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 1041w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 661w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/124259/8661480-rco023_1663771915.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Resurrected by The Five</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"/druig/4005-34947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34947\">Druig</a> of the <a href=\"/eternals/4060-13344/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13344\">Eternals</a> declared the mutants were a type of <a href=\"/deviants/4060-13345/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13345\">Deviants</a>, The Avengers, including Cap, banded together with pro-mutant Eternals to defend the new nation of <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\">Krakoa</a> from being wiped out. The ally Eternals planned to revive the dead Celestial that made up Avengers Mountain. This backfired when <a href=\"/progenitor/4005-149462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-149462\">The Progenitor</a> decided to judge the entirety of Earth: human, mutant, and Eternal alike. Cap was one of the first to be judged. Unfortunately, his failure to inspire the people of Earth to do better, as evidenced by the violent anti-mutant fervor that Druig had easily created, meant that Cap was considered a failure.</p><p>Stung by Progenitor's judgment, Cap fought through the demoralizing to continue to inspire people, while the smartest among the Eternals, Avengers, and mutants strategize a new plan. They decided to try Starfox's ability to influence feelings to convince it to stop. Offended by this attempt, the Celestial decided to unilaterally fail the planet and made a first attack on Cap's location. His shield protected him from the attack, but the civilians surrounding him were not as lucky. After a much needed civilian pep talk, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/4005-1461/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1461\">Nightcrawler </a>teleported Cap to the North Pole so that he could try to inspire the Celestial, only to be immediately killed. However, the real plan was for the mutant telepaths to connect everyone on Earth to Cap's speech as one last ditch effort to inspire the world to stand together. As a result, the mutants agreed to break policy and use <a href=\"/the-five/4060-64168/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-64168\">The Five</a> to resurrect Captain America.</p><h3>The Century Game</h3><p>While reconnecting with his old ham radio friends, <a href=\"/radio-company/4060-65467/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65467\">Radio Company</a>, their conversation was interrupted by a signal from an old numbers station that revealed plans for an attack on July 4th in New York. With Bucky's help, Cap monitored the situation and stopped an imposter <a href=\"/the-destroyer/4005-177887/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-177887\">Destroyer</a>, however, this was only the beginning. Evidence pointed Cap to the forge where his shield was created, as well as the clandestine organization that authorized the super solider program, <a href=\"/outer-circle/4060-65533/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-65533\">The Outer Circle</a>. A warning had been built into the shield by the rebellious blacksmith so that Cap would one day be able to confront them.</p><p>Cap revealed this information to Bucky, who, in turn, shared his information on the \"Starpoints,\" five assassins (including Bucky, Destroyer, and Peggy Carter) who were employed by The Outer Circle to turn the tide of history in their favor. With the help of another Starpoint, <a href=\"/redacted/4005-179951/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-179951\">Redacted</a>, they tracked down the Shadow Capital, the floating fortress of The Outer Circle. Although, Cap had every intention of taking them down, he was surprised by Bucky, who accepted an offer from Outer Circle member, <a href=\"/gavrilo-princip/4005-103640/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-103640\">The Revolution</a>, to kill him and take his place.</p><p>With a lead on the final Starpoint, <a href=\"/modoc/4005-180833/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-180833\">MODOC</a>, Cap put together a new team of Invaders to interrupt a raid on an old Zola lab that MODOC had arranged with the help of AIM. Unfortunately, MODOC was able to defeat the Invaders with his psychic abilities, forcing them to relive their worst memories. However, Invader member, Roger Aubrey, was able to break through the psychic barriers and free Cap and the others at the expense of his own life. This gave them the opportunity to take down MODOC, as well as, <a href=\"/the-power/4005-179218/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-179218\">The Power</a>, a member of the Outer Circle.</p><h3>Cold War</h3><p>Cap witnesses Ian Zola, who just revealed he was still alive, be kidnapped by Peggy Carter, working as a starpoint for Bucky and the Outer Circle. As a result, Cap and Sharon team up with Falcon and Misty Knight, who were already investigating the prison escape of White Wolf, also facilitated by Bucky. They track them to an Alaskan training facility where they were using Dimension Z portal tech to bring Dimension Z monsters to join their ranks. Determining Ian is being held by the White Wolf on the other side of the portal, the heroes head in together.</p><p>On the other side, they were nearly taken out by an explosion. Misty and Sharon are badly hurt, however, Cap pushes forward. Sam does his best to talk him down from being so headstrong, but being back in Dimension Z has causes Cap considerable post-traumatic stress. The two Caps are forced to duke it out with Sam eventually knocking some sense into Cap, who regrouped himself to rejoin his allies. Cap deferred to Sam who suggested they trade sparring partners. Sam and Sharon would go after Bucky, and Cap and Misty would go after the Wolf. Cap found Wolf mutated by Dimension Z into a monster werewolf, which he beat unconscious just before Sam delivered Bucky to be confronted.</p><p>Bucky revealed this was always his plan, for them to think he went to the dark side. He was actually using Wolf for access to Dimension Z so they could have the resources for an attack on the Outer Circle. Ian wasn't a real prisoner of Bucky's. Bucky intended him to take the throne from Wolf. Cap was suspicious, but Sam encouraged him and Sharon to stay behind and plan the attack while he and Misty returned to Earth to keep the peace until they returned.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4075262\" data-ratio=\"1.006718924972\" data-width=\"893\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 893px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4075262\"><img alt=\"Steve Rogers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" data-width=\"635\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.png 893w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.jpg 635w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Steve Rogers.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.png 893w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/80111/4075262-captain_america_alex_ross.jpg 635w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px\" data-width=\"635\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Steve Rogers.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'2 1/2\" / 1.89m</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 220 lbs. / 100kg</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Golden Blond</li><li><b>Identity:</b> Publicly known</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> \"Top Cop\" of America, Avenger, adventurer; former soldier, public works artist, special <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> operative, freelance illustrator, police officer, history teacher, sparring partner, WPA artist</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Manhattan, New York City, New York</li><li><b>Education:</b> High school graduate; one year of art school; military basic training; private tutoring in hand-to-hand combat, gymnastics, military strategy, piloting, demolition, and other disciplines</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> Steven Rogers (Captain America, ancestor, deceased), Joseph and Sarah Rogers (parents, deceased), unborn son (deceased), <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/nomad/4005-86745/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-86745\">Ian Rogers</a> (Nomad, adopted son)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3><strong><ins>Super-Soldier</ins><ins> Serum</ins></strong></h3><h4><strong>Ultimate Human Condition</strong></h4><p>In the beginning the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">Super-Soldier Serum</a> increased his body to the physical perfection of human potential or the next step in human evolution (though still a non-mutate). He is as strong, fast, durable and agile as any human could one day be - and his strength is referred to as being preternatural. His reflexes have also been increased to ultimate human potential and are nearly instantaneous (he is also capable of 'seeing faster' - enabling him to dodge bullets). He has run a mile in roughly a minute (approx 60 mph) and has bench-pressed 2200 pounds (1100 pounds on each side) for reps (just as a warm-up). His one-rep maximum is likely much higher. He also has uncanny accuracy, being able to hit multiple targets with a single throw of his shield, and having enough marksmanship to turn a light on and off through a shield throw alone.</p><p>Another major enhancement provided is the serum prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles. This means he effectively never tires, making it possible for him to perform at his maximum ability when doing anything physical for an extraordinary length of time. However Captain America has displayed feats that would appear to be far outside the limits of a human. One of Captain America's most recent durability feats is him surviving a 200ft fall on top of a car from an airplane and suffering no discomfort. Steve's enhancement has also allowed him to survive building collapses and major explosions.</p><p>The serum also enhances his constitution, making him immune or highly resistant to many diseases and increasing the speed at which he heals from injuries and recuperates from illness. The serum is constantly being replenished by his body down to a cellular level.</p><h3><strong><ins>Skills</ins></strong></h3><h4><strong>Master Martial Artist and Combatant</strong></h4><p>Cap is an expert and adept in virtually every technique and form of martial arts, hand to hand, and weapons combat. He is a master of a large number of martial arts and has developed his own unique fighting-style which melds American and bare-knuckle Boxing, Taekwondo, various styles of Karate, Judo, Aikido, Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujutsu, Muay Thai, Jeet Kun Do, Krav Maga, Savate, pressure points, all-terrain acrobatics and the use of his own shield. He is also able to learn how to use most weapons (if not all) quickly, as Beast has described Cap as being capable of mastering any weapon in seconds. He has used chi-manipulation and many other techniques. He is a quick learner and learned these skills in a short amount of time. The known martial arts Steve used in his fighting style (without counting the variations) including but not limited to: Boxing, Judo, Karate, Taekwondo, Aikido, Hapkido, Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Muay Boran, Jeet Kun Do, Kung Fu, Kickboxing, Wendu, Defendu, Okinawa-te, Savate, Sambo, Wrestling, Systema, Taijutsu, Wing Chun, Jujitsu, Brazilian Jujutsu, Capoeira, Wushu, Pencak Silat, Kobudo, Vale Tudo, Eskrima, Jojutsu, Kenjutsu, Kendo, Iaido, Iaijutsu, Bojutso, Shinobi-Iri, Intonjutsu, Ninjutsu, Shurikenjutsu, Kayakujutsu, Chi-Mon, Cho-ho, Bartitsu, Keysi, Fencing, Dambe, KAPAP and U.S. Army Combatives.</p><h4><strong>Master shield fighter</strong></h4><p>An accomplished master with his signature shield, Cap can hit multiple throws by calculating ricochets. He can also use his shield as a tool for assaulting and fight against his opponents using his shield while defending himself from their attacks.</p><h4><strong>Master Marksman</strong></h4><p>His aim is unerringly top-notch which makes him an extraordinary master marksman. He can throw his shield in the calculated way he wants and is skilled enough to use Hawkeye's Bow with the same accuracy and precision. He is also highly trained in the use of firearms and proved to be a deadly sharpshooter with several types of guns though he doesn't like to use them.</p><h4><strong>Master Swordsman and Staff/Stick fighter</strong></h4><p>Steve is an excellent sword fighter as he was able to fight Wolverine, a master swordsman, easily and gaining an upperhand against him and later by his time in The Avengers with The Swordsman, his skills and knowledge were praised by him. He also proved to be highly proficient in the sue of Bo staffs and Kali sticks, using Daredevil's billy club against himself with the same proficiency and skill which surprised Daredevil and commenting on them.</p><h4><strong>Master Strategist and Tactician</strong></h4><p>Cap is also a great and nearly unmatched leader, field commander, strategist and tactician. He led the Avengers for a long period of time, and his great experience makes him a seasoned commander on the battlefield. He also creates the plans for the Avengers. He also likes to keep himself prepared for any possible situation and study his opponents by any measure.</p><h4><strong>Master Hacker</strong></h4><p>Steve can hack into every form of digital data, systems and computers without leaving a trace or alerting security and tipping firearms with ease.</p><h4><strong>Expert in Arts of Espionage and Stealth</strong></h4><p>Cap is an expert and extremely experienced in fields of espionage, stealth, disguise, infiltration, escape arts, data gathering, sabotaging, surveillance and hostage-rescue as evident by his leadership and participation in almost every Secret Avengers mission.</p><h4><strong>Expert Military Operator</strong></h4><p>Also an expert military operator.

His costume covers up everything except his nose, mouth, and ears. It's made out of Kevlar, Nomex, lightweight Titanium and an unknown polymer. This costume offers a mid-high level of resistance against electric shocks and force impacts fundamentally. This suit cannot be pierced or slashed with simple and rather normal sharp materials like woods, glass, iron and aluminum. It's also resistant to high or low temperatures. In its helmet there is a small voice operated-wireless communicator which has its frequencies locked and almost untraceable that is also unaffected by jamming systems.</p><h4><strong><ins>Shield</ins></strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1647932\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1647932\"><img alt=\"Captain America's Shield\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg 512w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain America's Shield\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64293/1647932-untitled3.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain America's Shield</figcaption></figure><p>Cap's trademark weapon is his vibranium alloy <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/4055-50737/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-50737\">shield</a> in which he always carries with him. This shield is 2.5 feet / 70 cm in diameter and weight 12 pounds / 5.5 kg. The shield is virtually unbreakable and absorbs the kinetic force of anything that strikes it, which enables Cap to ricochet the shield off of objects and allow it to come back to him. Despite it being nearly unbreakable, it has shattered a few times but has needed a highly-powerful being to do such a feat, such as Thanos (with his Infinity Gauntlet) or Odin's brother, the Serpent. After giving the shield and costume to Bucky Barnes, Cap got a new costume and weapon. However, after Barnes faked his own death, Rogers would once again become Captain America and wield the shield. But then he lost his serum, and would become an old man. He would give the shield to Falcon as the new Captain America until Steve was again restored back to his youth, but allowed Sam to keep his trademark round shield and would instead wield an all-new one.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5052982\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static8.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5052982\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/5052982-capasr2016001-cov-88091.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Cap's (Hydra one) former wielded shield is similar in appearance to his classic, triangular shields he would use before he got his vibranium round one. This shield is made of an unknown metal, but is highly durable. The shield can split into two parts with the bottom part being capable of being shot at an opponent or disconnected if someone were to grab it. The biggest feature of the new shield is that of a laser blade that forms along the point of it that enables Cap to cut through things like steel with utter ease or used to dismember opponents.</p><h2><b>Alternate Realities</b></h2><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79617\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-79617\"><img alt=\"Ultimate Cap\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ultimate Cap\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/40/79617-148996-captain-america.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ultimate Cap</figcaption></figure><p>In the Ultimate universe, Captain America's origin was much the same. He became a hero due to the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/4055-55976/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55976\">Super-Soldier Serum</a> and fought in World War II. His sidekick is <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/4005-40470/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40470\">Bucky</a>, who photographs him and writes articles about him but isn't a costumed fighter. In his final mission, he attempts to sabotage a Nazi nuclear missile, and the resulting explosion throws him into the Atlantic Ocean, putting him in suspended animation. He is discovered fifty years later by <a href=\"/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Tony Stark</a>, and after reconciling with Bucky, is drafted into the <a href=\"/ultimates/4060-40504/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40504\">Ultimates </a>as the team's field leader.</p><p>He played a crucial part in the team's first mission - the Manhattan Crisis - when Bruce Banner injected himself with a Hulk serum mixed with Steve's blood, causing him to Hulk out and go on a rampage. During the battle, Captain America nearly manages to inject the antidote into Hulk, but Hulk ultimately prevents this. Regardless, it was Captain America who formulated the winning strategy by sending Wasp into the Hulk's brain. Banner's brain was the one soft part of his body, and Wasp's stings successfully bring down the berserk Hulk, changing him back into Banner.</p><p>After the Crisis, he learns of Hank Pym abusing Janet Pym, and proceeds to beat Giant-Man up. After successfully leading the team to defeat the <a href=\"/chitauri/4060-57559/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57559\">Chitauri </a>(an alien race of Nazi-allied shapeshifters whom Cap fought in WWII), Steve begins to date Jan. Captain America would then go on to lead the Ultimates in several other missions, including a clash with the Ultimate X-Men and fighting the super-villain group <a href=\"/sinister-six/4060-40429/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40429\">Six </a>- which was comprised of Ultimate Spider-Man's villains.</p><p>Six months after the battle with the Chitauri, Captain America participates in the team's joint operation with the <a href=\"/european-defense-initiative/4060-57488/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57488\">European Defense Initiative </a>to take down Thor. Thor had just recently quit the team, and his half-brother Loki's reality manipulating powers manage to trick the Ultimates into viewing Thor as a threat. Thor is soundly defeated by the two teams, and after the battle, the Ultimates would be sent into a Middle Eastern nation to destroy their nuclear arsenal.</p><p>But Loki's meddling is far from over, and after <a href=\"/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow </a>betrays the team and kidnaps Hawkeye while murdering his entire family, Loki magically alters the cameras in Hawkeye's home to make it appear as though Captain America was the perpetrator. As a result, S.H.I.E.L.D. successfully detains and incarcerates Cap. But all of this turns out to be ruses to weaken America when the <a href=\"/liberators/4060-51531/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51531\">Liberators </a>- a superhuman army comprised of the USA's enemies, attacks the nation. But Captain America is eventually freed with the help of the Wasp, and along with the rest of the Ultimates and America's superheroes, launches a counterattack against the Liberators. In the ensuing battle, Captain America defeats and executes the Liberators' leader, fellow super-soldier <a href=\"/colonel-abdul-al-rahman/4005-60048/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60048\">Colonel Abdul al-Rahman</a>. After the invasion of America is repelled, the Ultimates then decide to go independent (as their actions in the Middle East inadvertently triggered the invasion).</p><p>After this, <a href=\"/nick-fury/4005-3202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3202\">Nick Fury</a> would ask Cap to train the supposed mutant, <a href=\"/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>. He does so, but later finds out that Fury lied to him and that Fury has not let the Panther go home. With the help of Tony Stark, Steve makes himself a Black Panther disguise and joins the Ultimates as the Panther, allowing T'Challa to go home. Later in the <a href=\"/savage-land/4020-21766/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-21766\">Savage Lands</a> while battling the Juggernaut, the rest of the team finds out that the Black Panther they know has been Cap the whole time, and they manage to defeat Ultron. When the <a href=\"/ultimatum/4045-55745/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55745\">ULTIMATUM</a> Wave hits New York City, Cap is saved by Iron Man, but collapses and is taking to the Triskelion and put on life support. Cap later joins Thor in Valhalla, helping him fight Hela the goddess of death for Valkyrie's soul. Captain America ultimately survives the events of Ultimatum. Post-Ultimatum, Captain America and Hawkeye are on a mission when Cap runs into the Ultimate version of the Red Skull. They battle aboard a helicopter and Cap is quickly and brutally beaten by his adversary. Captain America later learns that this Skull is his son, but after the Skull secures a Cosmic Cube, Cap is forced to kill his own flesh and blood.</p><p>Captain America would continue to lead the New Ultimates in various missions, including going against Fury's black ops Avengers team and a vampire invasion. After the death of Spider-Man, he goes into exile over his failure to properly train the young superhero, but is later recalled back with the emergence of the grassroots terrorist group HYDRA. Subsequently, Ultimate Cap would eventually be elected as a wartime President of the United States. Shortly after resigning from presidency, Captain America was killed during <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a>' attack on New York.</p><p>Ultimate Captain America can lift 2 to 4 tons, and is rated by his handbook strength as a 4, while his 616 counterpart is only a 3. Ultimate Captain America is classified as a superhuman, and he has shown enough strength to harm even powerful combatants like the Hulk and <a href=\"/juggernaut/4005-1445/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1445\">Juggernaut</a>. His official bio states that he has mastered several martial arts, and has been shown to be able to defeat skilled fighters like Black Panther and <a href=\"/nuke/4005-41866/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41866\">Nuke</a>. Ultimate Captain America is also considered a tactical genius, and has formulated many successful battle plans and strategies, and has also displayed intelligence levels that enable him to hack into classified S.H.I.E.L.D. files. In contrast to his mainstream universe counterpart, Ultimate Cap is willing to resort to any means in order to win, and will often improvise and use any strategy to triumph. He also has a low-level healing factor. As well, he is more likely to kill than the 616 version, and seems to dislike the French, as proven by his infamous quote, \"You think this letter on my head stands for <strong>France!</strong><strong>\"</strong></p><p>His standard piece of equipment is a metallic shield designed by Hank Pym (later destroyed by Valkyrie but reforged by Asgardians), and his uniform has a vibranium chestplate and is Kevlar-lined to be bulletproof.

It has a computer inside which cooperates with his mind and works as a supporting device.

At some point in his past, Cap was held prisoner of the Red Skull and an army of Neo-Nazis; during this encounter, the Red Skull claimed that Dr. Abraham Erskine was secretly a member of the Nazi party. The Red Skull went on to explain that Adolf Hitler had funded scientists to work for the Allies, so that their discoveries would aid the Axis powers. The secret plan of the Nazis for the super-soldier project was to create a perfect Aryan race, and as such, they picked Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man with blond hair and blue eyes. Red Skull also went on to explain that the assassin that killed Erskine was originally meant to kill Rogers after his birth, and that Erskine's death was not intended. The Red Skull's claims have not been substantiated, and could have possibly been used as mental torture. Since then, the Red Skull and his followers began worshiping Captain America as Hitler's \"one true son\", and the Skull himself began attacking people in Cap's personal life whom the Skull deemed \"impure\" or \"unworthy\" of Cap. At some point either prior to or after the death of the Red Skull, Cap came into the possession of the Cosmic Cube once more. Knowing that he would be too tempted to use it, he turned it over to the only person he knew would not be tempted to use it nor give it up to Cap no matter how much he begged for it: the Black Panther.</p><p>World Wide Mutation: At some point during the world-wide mutation of humanity due to the release of Terrigen Mists into Earth's atmosphere, the Red Skull had tracked down and murdered Bernie Rosenthal, who was once the girlfriend of Captain America due to her brief association with Cap, and the Red Skull's belief that Captain America had to live up to Hitler's dream. The battle between Cap and the Red Skull following Bernie's death ended with Captain America decapitating the Red Skull with his shield. Following the Skull's death, Cap had vowed never to kill again. Soon after the Skull's death, Cap quit the Avengers because he felt that since he had killed the Red Skull out of revenge that his continued membership would taint their ranks. Not long after, all the Avengers (except the Vision) were murdered by the Absorbing Man in Washington, D.C. As the world's population began to rapidly mutate and anarchy spread across the world, Cap joined up with S.H.I.E.L.D. around the time that world meat shortages began. Soon after his joining of S.H.I.E.L.D., members of its organization were succumbing to the alien Hydra (including the Falcon, Dum Dum Dugan, Sharon Carter, and She-Hulk among others). When Norman Osborn bought his way into the White House, Captain America refused to serve under him or fight along with the Iron Avengers, a group of robots created by Tony Stark for Osborn to act as guardians of the United States and fight off the invasion of the alien Hydra. Soon the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier was taken down by Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury died in the crash. When Cap investigated the crashed helicarrier, he found a video on its main computer from Nick Fury warning that Osborn was behind the creation of the Hydra and that S.H.I.E.L.D. and Cap's friends were all targeted because Cap refused to work for Osborn.</p><p>Eventually, Cap returned to New York City and partnered up with Red Wing (Wyatt Wingfoot) and the Iron Avengers, finally working for Osborn, plotting to take him down, but it never came to pass.</p><p>Instead, during one of the Iron Avengers' routine sweeps through New York City to eliminate the Hydra hordes, Cap almost submitted to the members of Hydra's (all of whom were former friends of Cap) pleas to join the Hydra. When one of the Hydra approached with what appeared to be a cloth bearing the Punisher's old insignia but in red, Cap quickly rejected the Hydra's offer to join. After the Iron Avengers' seemingly eliminated the Hydra, Cap assumed that the symbol on the cloth was an indication that the Red Skull had somehow returned.</p><p>Soon, Cap and Red Wing traveled to the fallen S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier to see if its computers could locate any other sign of this red skull insignia and found a large concentration of the image on the west coast. Cap and Red Wing then traveled to the west in one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying cars.</p><p>In California, they found a large group of people (one of whom was Cap's old ally Marshall Maldoon) working under the banner, collecting fish from the ocean as a food source. This pillaging of the sea caught the attention of Namor, who attacked this group and he soon clashed with Iron Maiden. During the battle, he suddenly stopped and bowed down to their leader, who, to Cap's amazement was a teenage boy who went under the name of the Skull. It appeared that the Skull was able to make anyone in his vicinity his slave (it was later revealed that the Skull was in no way related to the Red Skull, but was really Benny Beckley, son of Comet Man. His powers were one of the many fail-safes that was implemented into human DNA by the Celestials when they originally manipulated the human race, so at a time when all humans had mutated, one of their numbers could control them all and they could better defend the planet from invaders).</p><p>Outraged by this form of slavery, Captain America and Red Wing confronted the Skull and demanded that he release the people that he controlled. The Skull found that Captain America was a laughing stock and took possession of Red Wing and had his masses attack Cap and drive him out of the vicinity. The Skull wanted Cap to be the only person free of his control, to mock the humbled hero.</p><p>Cap, without a cause, decided to remain on the west coast until he was approached by the Daredevil (not Matthew Murdock, but a freak show performer) who wanted to join Cap's cause because he figured it was a surefire way to die (Daredevil's mutation made it impossible for him to die). While Cap and Daredevil followed the Skull's progression across the United States, Cap had sent ahead Daredevil's circus companions to New York City to find Scott Summers (formally the X-Man, Cyclops) to train them to be the next X-Men. Aided by Pete Parker upon arriving in New York City, Cap and Daredevil located the Thing asking him to aid in rallying a counter army to stop the Skull from taking over the world. Using the tuning fork once belonging to the Inhuman royal pet named Lockjaw, Cap first approached Tony Stark to assist in battling the Skull. Stark insisted that his Iron Avengers would stop the army. However, the Iron Avengers were destroyed and as a result, President Osborn was assassinated by the Skull. Cap traveled the world recruiting superhumans from around the globe to assist in battling the Skull. From Japan, he recruited Lord Sunfire and his Red Ronin army; Ka-Zar and Shanna the She-Devil from the Savage Land; from Russia, he recruited Czar Colossus, the Black Widow, the Crimson Dynamo, and an army of Red Guardians; from Britain, Captain Britain, the Black Knight (secretly the son of Black Bolt), Dragon Man, and an army of Union Jacks, and finally Guardian and Sasquatch from Canada.</p><p>When Cap and his army traveled to Wakanda seeking aid from the Black Panther, Cap also asked to be given the Cosmic Cube for use against the Skull. The Black Panther refused to aid Cap and stated that should the Skull's army make their way to Wakanda, he would deal with the invaders on his own. With his army, Cap returned to New York City and made an attack on the Skull and his army, and even with the added power of the Hulk and Bruce Banner, the Skull gained the upper hand by taking control of most of Cap's warriors. Even after his defeat, the Skull refused to possess Cap and had his troops beat Cap. Cap made one final desperate lunge at the Skull and just before he was killed by Marshall Maldoon, he was rescued by Spider-Man, who had finally decided to get involved in heroics once more in order to save his daughter, Venom, who was one of the Skull's slaves. The two heroes returned to the Thing's loft where they regrouped with the Thing, and the X-Men, and they formulated a plan. After their first battle with the Skull, Cap had noticed that the Skull was unable to take control of the Hulk, and could only control the beast once he took control of Bruce Banner. Cap also realized that the Skull destroyed the Iron Avengers as opposed to taking control of them and realized that the Skull had no control over the mindless, and so employed the use of the Marvels (life-sized clay sculptures of many of Earth's heroes in their prime that were created and given life by Alicia Masters, the wife of the Thing).</p><p>The two heroes returned to the Thing's loft where they regrouped with the Thing, and the X-Men, and they formulated a plan.

He and the other Steves were baited into trying to escape to prove their worth for a multiversal army to stand against Mephisto.

The boy is needed for an experimental project to create a fascist super-soldier; however, Dr. Vaselli (Carla Cassola) objects to using the boy, and under the cover of gunfire, flees.</p><p>Seven years later, the American government finds a volunteer in Steve Rogers, a loyal all-American that is excluded from the draft because of his illness. The formula successfully transforms Rogers into the perfect soldier. Before any more super soldiers can be created using the formula kept in her head, Dr. Vaselli is murdered by a Nazi spy. Meanwhile, the Italian boy has become the Red Skull and is planning to launch a missile at the White House. Now code-named Captain America, he is sent in to defeat the Skull and deactivate the missile.</p><p>However, after a brutal battle, the Red Skull tricks and defeats Captain America and ties him to the missile as it is about to launch. Cap is able to grab hold of the Red Skull, forcing him to cut off his hand in order to avoid being launched into destruction with Cap. While the missile is overhead, a young boy named Thomas Kimball takes a photograph as Cap forces the missile to change course and land, where he remains frozen until 1993.</p><p>Kimball goes on to become an honest politician and Vietnam War hero until being elected the President. In 1993, a year into his term, he is pushing for pro-environmentalist legislation that is angering the military-industrial complex, who hold a secret conference led by the Red Skull.</p><p>After the War, the Red Skull had extensive plastic surgery done in a partially successful attempt to alter his disfigured features, raised a daughter, and became the leader of a powerful crime family. In the 1960s, this American military-industrial complex hired the Red Skull and his thugs to murder various Americans who were against their militarism and Red Skull's fascism, such as <a href=\"/martin-luther-king/4005-38841/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-38841\">Dr. Martin Luther King</a>, President John F. Kennedy, and <a href=\"/robert-kennedy/4005-35658/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-35658\">Robert Kennedy</a>. Now, Red Skull is targeting President Kimball for assassination.</p><p>Cap's frozen body is found by researchers, and he awakens still thinking that it is the 1940s. After battling some of the Red Skull's thugs, he brushes off Sam Kolawetz (Ned Beatty), a reporter and childhood friend of President Kimball, and hitchhikes his way back to his wartime girlfriend, Bernice (Kim Gillingham), in the movie.</p><p>While Bernice still lives at her old residence, she has long since married and raised her own daughter, Sharon. Sharon subsequently shows a series of VHS history tapes in order for Cap to catch up on what has happened while he was frozen in ice. Meanwhile, the Red Skull's thugs, lead by his daughter, break into Bernice's house and kill her. They also cause her husband to have a heart attack during their efforts to find where Cap is hiding out. Rogers and Sharon visit the secret underground base where he gained his superpowers, in the hopes that Dr. Vaselli's diary is still there and contains the original name of the Red Skull.</p><p>Although Rogers and Sharon find the diary, the Red Skull's thugs attempt to grab it. Rogers and Sharon vow revenge as well as the rescue of the recently kidnapped president. They locate and travel to the Red Skull's home and discover an old recording of the murder of his parents. Sharon agrees to be kidnapped in order to allow Steve Rogers, who once again dons his costume, to enter the Red Skull's castle.</p><p>In the midst of their battle, the Red Skull pulls out a remote trigger for an explosive device, but Cap knocks him off a cliff with his trademark shield before the bomb can be set off.</p><p>The United States Marines show up to save the President and arrest the Americans involved in the kidnapping. The credits roll with a comic book image of Captain in the background and a plea to support the United States Environmental Protection Act of 1990.</p><h3><ins>Marvel Cinematic Universe</ins></h3><h4>The Incredible Hulk (2008)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4209370\" data-ratio=\"0.42391304347826\" data-width=\"460\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 460px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4209370\"><img alt=\"Cap's frozen body\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg 460w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cap's frozen body\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg 460w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4209370-2721518471-capta.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cap's frozen body</figcaption></figure><p>A deleted scene in <a href=\"/the-incredible-hulk/4025-45/\" data-ref-id=\"4025-45\"><em>The Incredible Hulk</em></a> shows Captain America's still-frozen body.

When Scott Lang arrives and tells Steve and Natasha that time travel may hold the key to retrieving the Infinity Stones and using them to resurrect those who were killed by Thanos, Steve makes peace with Tony. He, Tony, and Scott travel back to 2012 (during the events of the first <em>Avengers</em> movie) in order to get both the Mind Stone and the Space Stone, but fail to retrieve the latter. Steve and Tony travel back even further to the 1970s, where they manage to get the Space Stone and more pym particles.</p><p>After successfully using the Infinity Stones to bring back most of those who died, Steve and the other Avengers battle Thanos and his army. It is here that Cap is able to use Mjolnir, proving that he is worthy. At the close of the film, he volunteers to go back in time to return the Infinity Stones to where they belong, but ultimately chooses to stay in the past to live out his life with Peggy. In the end, an aged Steve passes the shield and Captain America mantle to Sam.</p><h3><ins>Video Games</ins></h3><h4>Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7105977\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7105977\"><img alt=\"Doctor Doom's Revenge\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Doctor Doom's Revenge\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/7105977-cap%20game%203.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Doctor Doom's Revenge</figcaption></figure><p>Captain America is one of the two playable characters in this game, where he and Spider-Man battle a host of supervillains led by Doctor Doom.</p><h4>Captain America and The Avengers</h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5010578\" data-ratio=\"0.73125\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5010578\"><img alt=\"Captain America and The Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Captain America and The Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg 640w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/5010578-8660374191-snes_.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Captain America and The Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Captain America is one of the four playable Avengers in this game, alongside Iron Man, Hawkeye, and the Vision.</p><h4>Marvel vs Capcom series</h4><p>Captain America is a playable fighter in this series of Japanese fighting games.

Much like his 616 counterparts, Captain America served in WWII and was thought dead after his final mission. He attempted to disable a bomb launched by the Red Skull, and the resulting explosion threw him into Arctic waters, where he froze and remained in suspended animation for decades. Captain America was eventually found by the Avengers (who were searching for a rogue Hulk). After fighting his own WWII enemy Baron Zemo, as well as Arnim Zola and his creation <a href=\"/doughboy/4005-27858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27858\">Doughboy</a>, Captain America would then join the Avengers.</p><p>He served as a loyal member of the Avengers in their missions during this time. He and the rest of the Avengers aided Black Panther in reclaiming <a href=\"/wakanda/4020-41027/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41027\">Wakanda</a>, defeated Zemo's Masters of Evil, and Captain America also helped Hawkeye in his unsanctioned attack on HYDRA Island. But Captain America was the inadvertent cause of one of the Avengers' biggest threats when <a href=\"/kang/4005-2264/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2264\">Kang the Conqueror </a>traveled to the 21st century to kill Cap. He claimed that Cap was an anomaly in the space-time continuum, and that Captain America's betrayal would eventually lead to the destruction of Earth. Kang would eventually be defeated, but his claims would have repercussions in the next season. Captain America meanwhile, continued to adjust to 21st-century life; teaching Iron Man how to fight without his armor and getting used to the J.A.R.V.I.S. AI and the <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/4055-53156/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-53156\">Quinjet</a>.</p><p>The Avengers also went up against both A.I.M. and HYDRA, who were fighting over a Cosmic Cube created by the former. During the battle, Captain America wrestled with Baron von Strucker (leader of HYDRA) for the Cube, and they both touched it at the same time. While it seemed as though nothing happened, the Cube secretly worked - fulfilling Cap's truest desire - resurrecting his dead sidekick Bucky who was killed in the bomb's explosion during WWII. Subsequently, Cap would fight with the rest of the Avengers against Ultron, <a href=\"/malekith/4005-14469/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14469\">Malekith the Accursed</a>, and Loki with the power of Odin. At the end of the first season, Captain America was ambushed by a <a href=\"/skrulls/4060-40668/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40668\">Skrull </a>shapeshifter in his room, who announced that the invasion had begun.</p><p>At the start of the second season, Captain America started wearing an energy shield designed by Tony, to replace the shield he had lost when Odinforce Loki destroyed it. In one crucial mission, Baron Zemo, <a href=\"/crimson-dynamo/4005-7234/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7234\">Crimson Dynamo</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-man/4005-1465/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1465\">Wonder Man</a>, and <a href=\"/abomination/4005-3489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3489\">Abomination</a> sought the aid of the Avengers to defeat <a href=\"/enchantress/4005-7225/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7225\">Enchantress</a> and <a href=\"/executioner/4005-3517/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3517\">Executioner</a> (who were hunting down their former teammates). Zemo placed Captain America in charge of the plan to disable Enchantress's power because he knew he could trust Cap, but as the Skrull shapeshifter was masquerading in Cap's place, 'Captain America' betrayed Zemo. This was one of the hints that Cap had been replaced. Later on, when Iron Man receives intel that a member of his team is a Skrull shapeshifter, the team fractures in distrust and breaks apart. Only Captain America, Hulk, Wasp, and Hawkeye remained together.</p><p>As his Skrull impersonator continued to lead the team, the real Captain America was being tortured and held in a Skrull spaceship. They were trying to figure out how to break him, so as to learn how to defeat humanity, but failed to do so. Instead, Cap was able to engineer an escape, and temporarily teamed up with all of the superheroes and villains who were captured and impersonated - <a href=\"/merriam-drew/4005-29858/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-29858\">Madame Viper</a>, <a href=\"/mockingbird/4005-2497/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2497\">Mockingbird</a>, <a href=\"/clay-quartermain/4005-7524/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7524\">Agent Quartermain</a>, <a href=\"/cobra/4005-11895/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11895\">Cobra</a>, <a href=\"/henry-gyrich/4005-9711/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9711\">Henry Gyrich</a>, <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Invisible Woman</a>, and an A.I.M. grunt. Together, the group made an escape, hijacking a Skrull craft back to Earth and subduing <a href=\"/super-skrull/4005-21332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21332\">Super-Skrull</a>. Back on Earth, the fake Captain America gave the order for the Skrull fleet to begin infiltrating Wakanda and Washington, D.C. The Skrulls had realized that they shouldn't try to defeat humanity, but use 'Captain America' to convince them.</p><p>Back on Earth, the team is finally reassembled together after initial misunderstandings, and the Skrull invasion begins. Super-Skrulls are used to subdue the Avengers, and the Cap impersonator goes on live TV to try to subdue the human race by telling them to embrace the Skrull Empire (thus fulfilling Kang's claim that Cap's betrayal would end the world). But the real Cap returns, and together with the Avengers (Iron Man figured out how to reveal Skrull disguises as well), they defeat the invasion. Captain America successfully defeats his impersonator, though his reputation has been ruined in the fallout. As a result of his Skrull impersonator, the public turns against Cap and brands him a traitor. But after a mission with Spider-Man where they saved a group of innocents, the Daily Bugle clears his name.</p><p>Cap would then go on to fight in several other missions (facing off against the Vision, the Loki-Destroyer, Annihilus, and a Purple-Man controlled Iron Man) but his past would come back to haunt him when Senator Dell Rusk (secretly the Red Skull) attacks the team. The team was comprised of conditioned heroes, including the Winter Soldier - who was actually Bucky. Bucky and Cap eventually reconcile, though after defeating Red Skull and his <a href=\"/sleepers/4060-59673/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-59673\">Sleepers</a>, the two go their separate ways. After getting Hulk back on the team, the Avengers would then go on to fight the Kree Empire and the Supreme Intelligence, with the aid of Captain Marvel. The last episode of the series would also have the Avengers and all superheroes go up against <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> and his heralds.</p><p>In the final scene of the series, Galactus is defeated and the crowd cheers on as Captain America tells Iron Man, \"<em>You wanted to know how history will remember the Avengers, Iron Man? Well, here's your answer</em>.\"</p><p>Captain America has the Super-Soldier Serum in his veins, granting him peak human conditioning.

After the death of his parents, Peter was raised by his <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Uncle Ben</a> and <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> in a <a href=\"/forest-hills-residence/4020-57247/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57247\">modest house</a> in Forest Hills, <a href=\"/new-york-city/4020-41183/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41183\">New York</a>. While still in <a href=\"/midtown-high-school/4020-55690/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55690\">High School</a>, Peter attended a science exhibition about radiology where he was bitten by a <a href=\"/radioactive-spider/4055-56442/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56442\">radioactive spider</a>, granting him the proportionate strength and agility of a spider as well as a \"<a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a>\" that warns him of nearby danger. In order to test his new abilities - and earn some cash, Peter participated in a wrestling challenge against <a href=\"/crusher-hogan/4005-15480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15480\">Crusher Hogan</a>. He easily won the challenge and also gained the attention of the media. Afterward while backstage, Peter saw a burglar run past him but did nothing to stop him as it wasn't his problem. Later that night when Peter arrived home, he was told by a policeman that his Uncle Ben had been murdered by someone who broke into their house. The cop mentioned they had tracked the killer to a warehouse. In his anger, Peter put on his wrestling costume and went after the murderer himself. After arriving at the warehouse and easily defeating Uncle Ben's killer, Peter saw that it was the same <a href=\"/the-burglar/4005-15279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15279\">burglar</a> he didn't stop at the arena... thus learning that \"<a href=\"/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility/4015-40616/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-40616\">with great power comes great responsibility</a>\".</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026958\"><img alt=\"Spidey's First Appearance\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026958-amazing_fantasy_15.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></a><figcaption>Spidey's First Appearance</figcaption></figure><p>In 1962, <a href=\"/marvel/4010-31/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-31\">Marvel Comics</a> editor and head writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> was looking for a new superhero idea. He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired by the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"/martin-goodman/4040-43801/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-43801\">Martin Goodman</a> to introduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled series <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/4050-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-2043\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a>, which was renamed <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> for that issue (#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a> for an initial character design. However, Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby's attempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was supposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"/steve-ditko/4040-4026/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-4026\">Steve Ditko</a> who developed the now iconic look of Spider-Man. Spider-Man is one of the first characters whose problems made him feel more real, as people could relate more to him.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death, he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think; the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.</p><p>He has an extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on the said side.</p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate periods.</p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore, The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.</p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/4050-5533/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-5533\">Amazing Fantasy</a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"/kurt-busiek/4040-41741/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-41741\">Kurt Busiek</a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 - Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle's death. Even though <a href=\"/maxie-shiffman/4005-25215/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25215\">Maxie Shiffman</a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn't want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death, Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"/mr-vale/4005-83138/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83138\">Mr. Vale</a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spider-Man followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"/the-undertaker/4005-83137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-83137\">The Undertaker</a>. Spider-Man challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight, he discovered his <a href=\"/spider-sense/4015-56106/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-56106\">Spider-Sense</a> for the first time.

These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn't want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility for money. His heroism had also earned Spider-Man a certain fan named <a href=\"/flash-thompson/4005-1489/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1489\">Flash Thompson</a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"/josephine-pulaski/4005-25313/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25313\">Joey Pulaski</a> became friends. However, it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"/kingpin/4005-1483/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1483\">The Kingpin</a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey's defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super-powered being Spider-Man had encountered.</p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man's fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/4005-1487/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1487\">J.

As the host began to introducing the show's guests he was attacked by the super-powered villain <a href=\"/supercharger/4005-41244/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41244\">Supercharger</a>, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super-powered beings were. Spider-Man had never encountered a super villain before and thought real superheroes should deal with this. He attempted to call <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">The Fantastic Four</a> but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain. \"because that's what superheroes do\".</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3>Becoming a Hero</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61647727272727\" data-width=\"704\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 704px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056898\"><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 704w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death</figcaption></figure><p>Peter's first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Chameleon</a> who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Vulture</a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spider-Man managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape-shifting <a href=\"/sandman/4005-3544/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3544\">Sandman</a>, the lethal <a href=\"/lizard/4005-1488/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1488\">Lizard</a>, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"/enforcers/4060-32265/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-32265\">Enforcers</a>, <a href=\"/electro/4005-3228/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3228\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a>, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/4005-2475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2475\">Kraven the Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/4005-1468/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1468\">Doctor Doom</a>, and his soon-to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"/norman-osborn/4005-58812/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-58812\">Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"../../sinister-six/65-40429/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sinister Six</a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">Aunt May</a> and <a href=\"/betty-brant/4005-2484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2484\">Betty Brant</a>. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"/molten-man/4005-11554/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11554\">Molten Man</a>, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of <a href=\"/liz-allan/4005-15408/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15408\">Liz Allen</a>. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">the X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a>, and the <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Human Torch</a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with <a href=\"/ned-leeds/4005-12354/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12354\">Ned Leeds</a>.</p><h3>College Years</h3><p>After graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( <a href=\"/empire-state-university/4020-43783/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-43783\">Empire State University</a>) where Flash introduced him to <a href=\"/harry-osborn/4005-2478/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2478\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/4005-1480/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1480\">Gwen Stacy</a>. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually, their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"../../anna-may-watson/29-33193/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Anna Watson's</a> niece <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mary Jane</a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, <a href=\"../../captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Police Captain George Stacy</a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in <a href=\"../../london/34-55798/\" rel=\"nofollow \">London</a>.</p><h3>Arch-Nemesis: Green Goblin</h3><p>After suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter's Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority. The Web-Slinger managed to defeat him and knocked him into some chemicals, resulting in Norman having amnesia and no recollection of both his and Peter's alternate egos.</p><p>Spider-Man also fought the <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shocker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scorpion</a>. At one point, Peter felt that he was unable to carry the burden of being Spider-Man any longer and considered retiring from super-heroics. When the <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kingpin</a> of Crime made his move to take over the city, Peter knew that it was still his responsibility to protect the innocent and so he defeated this crime-lord and returned to crime-fighting.</p><h3>Death of Gwen Stacy and the Aftermath</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.0538194444444\" data-width=\"576\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:105.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862540\"><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" data-width=\"607\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of Spider-Man's defining moments</figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/4015-55821/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55821\">Silver Age</a>, Norman Osborn's memories began to flood back. He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. Gwen's death has affected Peter his entire career and is a big part of his character, as was Uncle Ben's death. He tracked the Goblin down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"../../jackal/29-10974/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Miles Warren</a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"/jackal/4005-10974/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10974\">Jackal</a>. He hired the <a href=\"../../punisher/29-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Punisher</a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Peter copy</a> escaped and <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy-clone/29-52936/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Gwen's copy</a> eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father's death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry's psychologist, <a href=\"../../bart-hamilton/29-34978/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Bart Hamilton</a> attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.</p><h3>Secret Wars and the Symbiote</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5324324324324\" data-width=\"370\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 370px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862547\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862547-secret_wars.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\" data-width=\"417\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beyonder</a> transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Battleworld</a> to take place in the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Secret Wars</a>, an intergalactic battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man's suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">black substance</a> that slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"/arachne/4005-16197/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16197\">Arachne's</a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reed Richards</a> who told him that it's actually a <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">living alien symbiote</a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit's design, Spider-Man's then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the <a href=\"/black-cat/4005-1479/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1479\">Black Cat</a> made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Eddie Brock</a> to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Venom</a>.</p><h3>Death of Jean DeWolff</h3><p>A close friend of Peter's, <a href=\"/jean-dewolff/4005-2471/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2471\">Jean DeWolff</a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"/sin-eater/4005-11206/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11206\">Sin-Eater</a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side. After saving Betty Brant from the criminal, Spider-Man was tempted to kill him but was stopped by <a href=\"/daredevil/4005-24694/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24694\">Daredevil</a>.

MJ heard the sounds of battle. After Peter defeated Puma, MJ confessed to him that she cannot handle the danger he puts himself in. She tells him that she has always known his secret identity. Black Cat appears to reconcile with Peter which caused MJ to run away crying. She considered leaving town again but she then decided to confront Peter. They became very close and they would tell each other everything. They were hiding from their true feelings and Peter proposed to MJ. Although she initially refused, after making amends with her <a href=\"/gayle-watson/4005-84116/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-84116\">sister</a>, MJ returned to Peter and accepted his proposal. Despite knowing that they are still too young and Peter's double life may make things difficult, Peter and Mary Jane tied the knot.</p><h3>Kraven's Last Hunt</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056896\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.46\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:146.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2056896\"><img alt=\"Kraven's Last Hunt\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kraven's Last Hunt\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kraven's Last Hunt</figcaption></figure><p>Peter's life did not get any easier after his wedding. As soon as he returned from his honeymoon, he was attacked by <a href=\"../../kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Kraven the Hunter</a> in one of the most traumatizing events in both Peter and MJ's lives. Kraven was seeking to regain the honor that his family had lost and to do so, he must prove his superiority over his greatest foe, Spider-Man. After ambushing him, Kraven shot Peter in the head with a rifle and buried him on his grounds. Kraven donned a black Spider-Man costume and became a merciless vigilante. He even defeated <a href=\"../../vermin/29-6818/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Vermin</a>, a villain Spider-Man could not defeat on his own. After two weeks, it was revealed that Spider-Man was actually alive and Kraven shot him with a tranquilizer. Peter eventually made his way to Kraven's estate and brutally pummeled the hunter. Kraven was unconcerned as he has proven his superiority over his foe before and so he set the <a href=\"/vermin/4005-6818/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6818\">Vermin</a> free.

He then became very angry with Spider-Man, when the web-slinger unmasked Sin-Eater and it turned out to be a different person. This caused Brock professional humiliation and the loss of his job. When Eddie bonded with the symbiote and became <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Venom</a>, Eddie launched several attacks on Peter's life, even scaring MJ. Peter stopped wearing the black suit following MJ's request.

Sometime later, Peter and Eddie formed a truce, promising never to interfere with each other's lives ever again.</p><h3>Death of Harry Osborn</h3><p>Harry Osborn's memories of being the Green Goblin came flooding back and he attempted to ruin Peter's life one more time. Before destroying a building that contained Peter, MJ, and his son <a href=\"../../normie-osborn/29-11552/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Normie</a>, Harry regained his sanity and managed to save them.

They turned out to be robots invented by the Chameleon to infiltrate Peter's life, discover his connections to Spider-Man and then kill him. The robot that masqueraded as Peter's father Richard was perfectly willing to accomplish his task and kill Peter, but the Mary robot had learned to love Peter and saw him as a good person. Richard turned into a vicious engine of destruction. Before Richard could finish Peter off, Mary killed him using an electric cable. In return, she was killed by the Vulture who was conspiring with the Chameleon. An enraged Spider-Man completely pummeled the Vulture but was stopped by the cries of his dying \"mother\". She told Peter in her last moments that despite everything, she still loved him. Spider-Man vowed to track down the Chameleon and make him suffer, which he eventually did after fighting through many assassins sent by the communist.

For years he was believed to have died after his initial encounter with the real Peter Parker. The clone, who is now calling himself <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ben Reilly</a> spent years traveling the world as he knew there was no place for him in New York City again. When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first, the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a threat, but later on, the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. It was also during this time that aunt May seemingly died of old age. Before she passed away, she told Peter that she had known about him being Spider-man for some time now. Years later, it would be revealed that it was not aunt May that had died, but a stand-in that was the work of Norman Osborn. Peter remained out of super-heroin for some time, until his powers seemingly returned and he and the Scarlet Spider fought side by side for some time. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died. On that day, Peter felt to have lost a brother. Although Norman Osborn was defeated, it was far from the last thing that was heard from him. With his powers fully returned, Peter resumed his work as the Amazing Spider-Man once again.</p><h3>The Identity Crisis</h3><p>After this saga, the <a href=\"/spider-man-identity-crisis/4045-55684/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-55684\">Identity Crisis</a> story takes place in which Spider-Man is accused by a returned Norman Osborn of murder and a bounty is put on his head. This is done by Norman Osborn, who had cleared his name as a criminal when he proclaimed that he was not really the Green Goblin, but was set up by this criminal. He had taken over the Daily Bugle and put a price on Spider-Man's head in the newspaper. This lead to a variate of bounty-hunters to attack Spider-Man. Feeling it to dangerous for himself and his loved ones to remain the hero he is, Peter retires from being Spider-Man and forms four different identities which he uses to keep on helping people and in the meantime clear his name. Eventually, Peter's name was cleared and he returned to being Spider-Man.</p><h3>Gathering of the Five</h3><p>It seemed that Spider-man was finally back on track, with his name cleared and his life finally looking a bit better than it had in recent months. Norman Osborn however kept being a disturbing presence to Peter and Mary Jane. He started a ritual known as the Gathering of the Five, with one person getting Ultimate power, one got death, one got insanity, and so on. Norman thought he gained power, but it turned out that it was insanity that he got. He attacked and kidnapped Peter. While he was captive, Peter got the shock of a lifetime. His aunt May was standing in front of him, alive and well. After Spider-man broke free and defeated Norman Osborn, seemingly for good, as he was taken to a mental hospital, Peter learned that it was in fact aunt May he found. Not a clone, not a hoax. Norman had apparently kidnapped May years ago and had an actress surgically look like aunt May and play her part while she was dying. This was why 'aunt May' knew about Peter being Spider-Man, she was hired by Norman Osborn to play her! Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four assured Peter it was his aunt. Peter saw this as a sign and stopped being Spider-Man altogether, finally living a good life with his aunt May and his wife Mary Jane.</p><h3>A New Chapter in Life and a New Spider-Woman</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ratio=\"1.1566820276498\" data-width=\"651\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 651px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:115.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1509302\"><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 651w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/1790/1509302-mattie1.png 553w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" data-width=\"553\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peter discovers the identity of the new Spider-Woman</figcaption></figure><p>After Peter had his aunt returned, he decided to stop being Spider-man for good. He started living in a new apartment with his aunt May and wife Mary Jane. All of New York was wondering where Spider-Man could have gone after his seemingly final battle with the Green Goblin. He would not even react to messages send by Peter's good friend the Human Torch. Peter had found a job at a science-center where he did good work and stayed out of the superhero life, although it turned out that was harder than it seemed. It was at this time that a seemingly new Spider-Man appeared on the scene. It turned out that this was Mattie Franklin, a participant in the Gathering of the Five, who got the gift of Power. She acted as Spider-man and later as Spider-Woman when Peter finally accepted that he was needed as Spider-man and returned to life as a superhero.</p><p>All seemed to go well again until Mary Jane, who had started acting again, was threatened by a stalker. It started with phone-calls, but when Mary Jane took a plane, it exploded in mid-air and seemingly killed Mary Jane. Peter, firstly stricken with grief, did not believe she had died. He knew it must have had something to do with the stalker, and Peter started a crusade to find out the truth. This brought him to Latveria and in a fight against the Hulk among others. Eventually, Peter learned that it was indeed the stalker that had faked Mary Jane's death and had held her captive during it all. The stalker was a mutant that absorbed all of Peter's memories when he was saved by him during one of Spider-man's fights on the streets of New York. The Stalker needed Mary-Jan for himself because of it and he felled he knew her. Spider-man managed to save Mary Jane and defeat the Stalker. Mary Jane however was traumatized by the experience and needed time off from her life as the wife of a superhero. The two parted ways for some time.</p><h3>A Death in the Family</h3><p>Norman Osborn broke out of jail and managed to clear his name of being the Green Goblin. After failing to convert Peter into his heir, he started to provoke Peter into killing him in a story called <a href=\"../../a-death-in-the-family/39-56294/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A Death in the Family</a>. Norman was sick of his life and wanted to die at the hands of Spider-man. He tried to get Peter so mad that he would do this. First by releasing footage of Gwen's death to the media, claiming that Gwen's death was the result of Spider-Man's selfish actions. To make matters worse, Norman forced a drunken Flash Thompson to have a car accident, causing him to go into a coma. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin meet up in one of Osborn's warehouses where Spider-Man defeats the Goblin. Although he urged him to finish him off, Peter refused to play the Goblin's game and proposed a truce. Norman accepts, but as he returns to one of his offices, he puts a gun in his mouth. He is however to afraid to pull the trigger.</p><h3>Ezekiel</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5275\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-149541\"><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-man and Ezekiel\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/149541-110898-ezekiel.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" data-width=\"418\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-man and Ezekiel</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-man meets a strange individual named Ezekiel, who knows that he is truly Peter Parker, and warns him of a powerful enemy who will try to kill him, known as Morlun. Peter follows Ezekiel and tries to find out why he knows so much about him. Ezekiel tells Spider-man that he is part of a \"Spider-Totem\", which is why his enemies all are animals as well (Rhino, Lizard, Doctor Octopus, Vulture). Spider-man does not care much about these strange stories but is happy with the help that Ezekiel provides when he finally encounters Morlun. He barely defeats Morlun and struggles back home after the fight. He lands on his bed, with a torn-up Spider-man costume and falls asleep. It is at this time that aunt May enters the room and sees Peter as Spider-Man. The secret is finally out! Aunt May walks away and uses a full day to comprehend the facts before she finally confronts Peter with it. Peter tried to talk his way out of it but finally sees that it is no use and then told his aunt May about why he became Spider-Man. It was during this time that Peter and Mary Jane again renewed their relationship and their marriage vows.

His eyes glow red, his teeth become razor sharp and two poison stingers sprout from his arms. Peter attacks Morlun, stabs him in the shoulder with one of his stingers, and bites him in the neck. He then apparently dies in MJ's arms. He finds himself face to face with a Spider monster who tells Peter that he has to either accept his spider side and evolve or die. Spider-Man embraces his \"other\" and recovers.

A loud explosion is heard nearby his apartment and Peter goes to check it out only to see Arachne fighting off Ana and Alyosha Kravinoff. Peter, being weakened by the swine flu, struggles to put up a fight and manages to impale Alyosha on a broken pipe, gaining him time to retrieve Arachne and to escape. After retreating to Mattie Franklin's apartment, they are approached by a dead Ezekiel. He then tells Spider-Man and Arachne that they have to save Arana from the clutches of the Kravinoff's. As they finally reach her, they become outnumbered and defeated and Arachne and Arana are captured. Kaine eventually arrives to help out but was too late to make a difference.

Spider-man then gets ambushed and killed by the Kravinoff's. With Kraven finally back from the dead, he shows his anger at Sasha by confirming that the blood was not that of the real Spider-Man but of his clone Kaine. When Peter awakens, he finds Kaine's body in a coffin with a note reading \"Hunt me\" and his black costume lying beside the coffin. Spider-Man begins to hunt the Kravinoff's one by one, first taking out Chameleon and nearly killing Vladimir with a giant tombstone before dodging a point-blank shot from Alyosha's rifle. Spider-man than appears on the roof of the mansion and attacks Sasha, leaving the mark of Kaine on her face (using his finger's abilities to rip the skin off of her face) in revenge for the death of his clone and \"brother\". Spider-Man and Kraven then proceed to engage into battle and the fight proves to be completely one-sided as Peter goes all out with the intentions of killing Kraven for the murders of his friends. As he is about to deliver the killing blow to Kraven with his own spear, Arachne (As the new Madame Web) appears and shows Spider-man a grim future that would follow if he decided to murder Kraven.

He takes on the mission Kingpin initially assigned to Kingsley, which involved stealing a metal called reverbium from Horizon Labs. On Peter's first day at Horizon Labs, the lab is attacked by the new Hobgoblin who is using new weapons. After a fight with Spider-Man, Phil steals the reverbium and delivers it to Kingpin who allows Phil to work for him. Spider-Man designs himself a new Stealth Suit (Which has the ability to turn invisible.) to overcome Phil's Goblin Laugh which incapacitated him in their previous encounter. Along with the Black Cat, he attempts to take down Kingpin and Hobgoblin and steal back the reverbium. At Fisk Towers, Spider-Man and the Black Cat fight the Hobgoblin, Kingpin, and his Hand Ninjas.

Smythe returns Mac Gargan to his <a href=\"/mac-gargan/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a> identity and attacks the launch site where John is flying the Vertex shuttle into orbit which will meet up with a <a href=\"/horizon-labs/4020-57110/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-57110\">Horizon Labs</a> space station. Spider-Man appears and web lines to a shuttle that just took off. Smythe has locked down the controls and rigged its booster rockets to explode before it leaves the atmosphere.</p><p>To make matters worse, the evolved Scorpion appears to kill Spider-Man.

But Spidey and his friends cannot hurt the Insect Army, they can barely even touch them, as Smythe gave them their own spider-sense. Peter with the help of Max Modell creates the spider-sense disruptor. He is given the detonator and must be far from the center of the \"explosion\" or his sense might be also caught in. But during the second fight against the Scorpion, Scorpion destroys the detonator, and Spider-Man must do it manually. And when he detonates it he is caught in the epicenter. The Insect Army has lost the spider-sense, but so has Spider-Man. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion, he goes to check on the others but Smythe suddenly appears and Spider-Man had not seen it coming due to not having spider-sense, but <a href=\"/marla-jameson/4005-10671/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10671\">Marla Jameson</a> did.

When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr. Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading. While at a lab, Peter and Carlie are attacked by Chance, Scorcher, and White Rabbit, who also have spider powers. Peter manages to defeat them using his training from Shang-Chi. Jackal has the battle taped and gives it to Tarantula to study, as he will soon be 'tested'. Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider powers but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however, Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spider-Man when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms. After taking off his mask, they find that his face is slowly mutating into a spider's face, and his body is doing the same. Carlie starts to mutate as well. The Spider-Queen tells Jackal that the people of New York will soon become spiders, and she will own New York.</p><p>Reed and Horizon finally develop a cure to the virus, based on Anti-Venom's symbiotic abilities, able to kill the virus and reverse the mutation, turning the spiders into normal people again. However, the Spider-Queen sends Tarantula to poison the serum; Peter fights him off, and Reed and Horizon manage to give Peter back his spider-sense. Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.</p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship with Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several Autobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.</p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people. Carlie deduces who Peter is and promptly breaks up with him for lying to her. Mary Jane admits her love for Peter, and Peter administers an antidote to her. The two look up at the Empire State Building, which is projecting a red and blue light, thanking Spider-Man for his heroic deeds.</p><h3>Ends of the Earth</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.76848484848485\" data-width=\"1650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2376781\"><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mind Controlled Avengers\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 1650w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2376781-amazing_686_thegroup_018.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mind Controlled Avengers</figcaption></figure><p>Doc Ock knows that he is soon going to die. Before his death, he wants to be remembered as the man who saved the world by stopping the Greenhouse effect. Spider-man doesn't believe Octavius, however, so he gathers the Avengers in order to discover Ock's true plan and put a stop to it. Unknown to Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus was well prepared for the fight and the Sinister Six subdue the Avengers. Doc Ock is about to kill Spider-Man, but Silver Sable comes to the rescue. She saves Peter and the Black Widow, and they set off to Octavius' manufacturing plants. There they encounter the Sandman, but they manage to beat him. Doc Ock asked the nations to capture Spider-Man (his position enabled him to do so) and he also called on many villains to take down Spider-Man. Parker knows that he can't stop Otto alone, so he asks other heroes to destroys Ock's facilities. When Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable reach the main base in Romania, Doctor Octopus activates his satellites, and every area that faces the sun explodes. It later turns out that this was only an illusion created by Mysterio, rather than reality. Spider-Man captures Mysterio and finds out that Doc Ock is hiding in Guatemala, but after Pete, Silver, and Natasha arrive at the site they're attacked by a group of mind-controlled Avengers. Spider-Man, Black Widow, and Silver Sable gain an edge because the mind-controlled Avengers are unable to fight as well as they would normally, and the Avengers are able to return to their senses thanks to Mysterio's technology.</p><p>Black Widow was knocked out during the fight, however. Doctor Octopus launched several missiles so the Red Hulk, Iron Man, and Thor try to put an end to it. Mysterio reveals that Octavius' base is underwater, so Spider-Man and Sable resolve to put an end to Otto's plot once and for all. They, unfortunately, meet Rhino on their way, and he catches Sable and begins choking her in the water. With her final breath, Silver tells Peter to leave her and stop Otto. Spider-man is desperate to help her, but he knows that he's running out of time and is left with no choice. Spider-Man finally finds and battles Octavius, but he is eventually caught in the Doc's metal tentacles. With Parker trapped, Octavius reveals that his plan is to scar the earth, to be worse than Hitler and the other monsters, and in that way be remembered. Octopus removes his armor in order to activate his master plan, but Spider-Man tells Doc Ock that he had made an error in allowing himself to be distracted just long enough for Peter to break free. Spider-Man saves both Doctor Octopus and the world, but at the cost of Silver Sable's life.</p><h3>No Turning Back</h3><p>It's been three weeks since spider-man foiled Doc Ock's plan and now Peter is invited to MJ's, which is Mary Jane's Club, but he is still under the weather because he was not able to prevent Silver Sable's death, but while Peter is \"having fun\" at the party Carlie calls and tells Spider-man to come to meet her at the cemetery. Spider-Man arrives and Carlie tells him that the groundskeeper saw a pale man digging the grave of Billie Connors with his bare hands and then vanishing into the dark with the body. Spider-Man instantly realized that this pale powerful man was Morbius and he goes to face him at Horizon labs. Spider-Man, disgusted by Morbius' actions, starts to attack him but eventually stops when Michael explains that the reason he dug up the grave was to find a cure for the Lizard, and he tells Peter that he has already accomplished his goal. Spider-Man, hearing this, plans an attack on the Lizard and confronts him in the sewers and fights him for a long period of time, but finally, Morbius and Spider-Man stab the Lizard with enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to bring Connor's back. But the Lizard is still in control, even in Kurt's body.</p><p>The Lizard awakens Morbius' violent vampire side, with the smell of blood. And while Spider-Man was distracted by Morbius, Connors created the new serum that will turn him into the Lizard again, but this serum turns everyone into lizards except Connors himself, so while testing this serum Connors turns the entire Horizon Labs crew into Lizards. When he finally created the serum for himself, it turned him into a new version of the Lizard. When Spider-Man comes after capturing Morbius, Carlie tells him what has happened. Spidey creates a new cure and a battle ensures between Spider-Man and the Lizard. When Spider-Man stabs the Lizard with a harpoon filled with the cure, nothing happens, the cure doesn't work. Only at the end, we see that the cure has actually worked, and now Connors' mind is secretly in control of the Lizard's body.</p><h3>Alpha</h3><p>A teen outcast Andy Maguire went on a trip from his school to Horizon Labs, where Peter Parker was holding an experiment. Tiberius Stone, not liking Peter, sabotages the experiment, and Andy is hit with a ray of Peter Particles. Soon after he discovers he has super-powers. When he is examined by top greatest superhuman specialists, Reed Richards, Tony Stark, Henry Pym, and Hank McCoy, they discover that he has energy projection, flight, super speed, super strength, and force field, but his limitation is he can control only one power at a time. Reed tells Peter that he had discovered these particles, but didn't publish his work, because he considered the particles too powerful and dangerous.</p><p>He then assigns Alpha as Spider-Man's sidekick. Alpha is however very careless and eventually quits working with Spider-Man and goes solo. Spider-Man decides then that there should be Alpha no more! Soon when the earth is under attack from Terminus, Alpha is called by Captain America to fight him. During the fight, Alpha behaves most irresponsible and almost destroys planes flying in the air. Though Alpha defeats Terminus, Peter observes that Terminus' staff can redirect Alpha energy. Then Spider-Man calls Alpha for another \"analysis\" and uses the tech acquired from the Terminus to strip Andy of his Alpha power, leaving him as nobody again.</p><h3>Dying Wish</h3><p>Using a modified Octo-bot, Octavius successfully transfers his consciousnesses into Spider-Man, leaving him with Peter's memories and body and Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus's dying one. After leaving Peter for dead Otto begins to take on Spider-Man's life as his own. Peter eventually took control of the golden Octo-bot and using one of Doc Ock's own contingency plans had <a href=\"/scorpion/4005-4484/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4484\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/hydro-man/4005-4457/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4457\">Hydro-Man</a> and <a href=\"/trapster/4005-4328/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4328\">Trapster</a> free himself from the <a href=\"/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> prison <a href=\"/the-raft/4020-50736/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-50736\">The Raft</a>. It was then that Peter tried to redo the body switch with Ock who had taken precautions to keep that from happening. Peter instead had Otto relive all of Peter's memories showing Dr. Octopus how much he had wasted his life. As a result of Peter's personality grafted to his own, Dr. Octopus decided to continue on as Spider-Man and make up for his past mistakes as the Superior Spider-man.</p><h3>Superior Spider-Man</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5177777777778\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2903877\"><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 632w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/118689/2903877-2767530_2700867_supsm2013001_camunvar_1_.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"></noscript></a><figcaption>SPIDEY IS THAT YOU!?</figcaption></figure><p>However, Parker still existed within Doctor Octopus's mind in the memories that he absorbed. The consciousness intent on stopping the villain and reclaiming his life tries to influence Octavius but fails to do so in any more than the slightest of ways. Parker's remnant also inadvertently causes Otto to share Peter's genuine love for Mary Jane Watson, and so pushes her away for her own safety. After Otto used a brain scanner to treat a young girl's brain injury, he decided to use the device on himself to discover Parker's presence within his mind. A mental battle ensues between himself and Parker, which Otto seemingly wins, erasing Peter's memories.</p><p>After Octavius tries to retrieve some of Parker's memories in an attempt to solve a reverbium related problem, Peter's consciousness begins to re-emerge, having somehow escaped the mind-purge. When Otto is possessed by the Venom Symbiote and is unable to free himself of it, Peter's consciousness again emerges and breaks the Symbiote's hold over Dr. Octopus, enabling Flash Thompson to call it back to him.</p><p>Peter Parker's re-emerged consciousness begins to explore his Mindscape, discovering the world is now a large empty space, with only the very few key memories left. Recalling that he's more than Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man, he declares that Otto had made a big mistake in leaving the memories that define him and promises to find a way to regain control of his body. Continuing to explore the Mindscape for clues into reclaiming his body from Doctor Octopus, he makes a note that only 31 pieces of his memories are left and wonders what he can do with them. Just then, he stumbles upon the memory of his fight with the Green Goblin at the Brooklyn Bridge, wonders why Doctor Octopus is probing into this. Deciding to delve into Doctor Octopus's memories for a way out, he is overwhelmed by the number of memories and struggles to hold on. He sees a bright light and witnesses the moment of Otto Octavius's birth. Peter Parker's consciousness struggles to fight against the deluge of Doctor Octopus' memories, but it proves too much and he convinces himself that he is Doctor Octopus merging with Otto's memories.</p><h3>Spider-Verse</h3><p>While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company, Peter learned of the existence of Cindy Moon, a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had, in fact, survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\" data-ratio=\"1.5443262411348\" data-width=\"564\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 564px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5388789\"><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web Warriors\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 564w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11125/111254576/5388789-b50f397cfedeaaf320fbf7f7602c3ca1.jpg 414w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" data-width=\"414\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Web Warriors</figcaption></figure><p>Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as Silk, Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099 A.D., the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.</p><p>The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to Earth-3145 after their safe zone in Earth-13 had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother Jennix, and his father and leader of the Inheritors, Solus. With the help of Spider-Woman, who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on Earth-001, the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were Kaine Parker, Cindy Moon, and Benjy Parker of Earth-982, respectively.</p><p>With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named Karn, the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as \"Spider-Gwen,\" launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of Earth-001. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145.</p><p>With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing the memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.</p><h3>Rise and Fall of Parker Industries</h3><p>Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the Living Brain. Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\" data-ratio=\"1.4008152173913\" data-width=\"736\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 736px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.1%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4833044\"><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Web-Ware\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 736w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 685w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11124/111242198/4833044-983a3fb487f08444f7850072d5bf6b56.png 456w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" data-width=\"456\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Web-Ware</figcaption></figure><p>As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the Webware. This change in Peter's life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.</p><p>One of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the Transamerica Pyramid, called New U. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy. In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly, who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place.</p><p>The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the Carrion Virus worldwide. The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webware transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died. The Jackal, is a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.</p><p>Afterward, Peter teamed-up again with Teresa Durand, a CIA agent with whom Peter had already joined forces in a mission at least a year ago during which she was seemingly brainwashed by the Kingpin and Mentallo to believe she was Peter's long-lost sister. Teresa sought Peter's help when on the run from a government organization called the Gray Blade.</p><p>Hydra's take-over of the United States of America temporarily put a halt to Peter and Teresa's escapades. Numerous headquarters of Parker Industries around the globe were then targeted by the forces of the terrorist organization, namely a unit led by one of Hydra's latest additions, the duplicate of Doctor Octopus, who had gained a physical body through the Jackal's cloning technology.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort to prevent the resources of Parker Industries from falling in the hands of Octavius and Hydra, Parker had his employees obliterate all systems of the company, running Parker Industries into the ground. He later fought alongside the rest of America's superheroes that assembled in Washington, D.C. to retake the United States from Hydra's control.</p><p>Despite having his civilian reputation smeared due to his company's collapse, Peter quickly got back on his feet. After beginning a short-lived relationship with Parker Industries' former S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison Mockingbird, Peter was hired by Robbie Robertson as the editor for the Daily Bugle's science section.</p><p>Before Peter recovered himself, however, his adventure with Teresa continued, who discovered that she truly was Mary and Richard Parker's daughter, and shared this information with Peter.</p><p>Not long after Peter had decided to reveal his secret identity to Jameson, Jonah was kidnapped by Norman Osborn, and accidentally let it slip that Peter was Spider-Man. In addition to having regained his powers, Osborn had bonded with the Carnage Symbiote, giving birth to the Red Goblin.</p><p>Peter failed to take down Osborn despite the help from his allies, and was overpowered in battle even after Eddie Brock had lent him his symbiote. Peter only managed to defeat Osborn in a fight after tricking him into rejecting the symbiote, having claimed that any credit for his defeat would go to the Carnage symbiote and not Osborn himself. Unfortunately, the process of defeating Osborn cost the life of Spider-Man's biggest fan, Flash Thompson, who had recently become the superhero Agent Anti-Venom.</p><h3>Kindred Rising</h3><p>Following Osborn's defeat, Peter's life was presented with several tribulations. After becoming Mayor of NYC, Kingpin became publicly accepting of Spider-Man while condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate the Web-Slinger from his super hero peers. In his civilian identity, Peter was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius. Unable to defend himself without exposing his secret identity, Peter had his credentials revoked, causing him to be fired from the Daily Bugle.</p><p>On the other hand, Peter became romantically involved again with Mary Jane, and was given an opportunity to re-apply for his doctoral thesis on the recommendation of Dr. Curt Connors, leading Peter to re-enroll at the Empire State University to earn his college degree himself. Peter also moved into a shared apartment with Randy Robertson and Frederick Myers, the alter-ego of the super villain Boomerang, with whom Peter eventually developed a friendship both as Parker and Spider-Man.</p><p>During this time, Peter became the target of fixation of a mysterious supernatural entity that dubbed himself \"Kindred\" to hide his true identity, that of Harry Osborn, somehow turned into a demonic creature consumed by the belief that Peter had to repent for his sins and the misery he brought on his loved ones.</p><p>As Kindred, Harry pulled the strings of Peter's life to ensure no harm befell him until they could meet directly, while also forcing him and Mary Jane apart by employing Mysterio to have her career make her move to the West coast to film for some months. Kindred only presented himself to Peter in nebulous nightmares to further his psychological torment, leaving him with the uneasy sensation that somebody was lurking.</p><p>Due to Octavius' reckless experimentations with the Inheritor's technology, the totem-hunting family broke free from their prison, with Morlun personally going after Peter. Spider-Man was successful in defeating Morlun with the help of J. Jonah Jameson and the NYPD, and managed to join the reassembled Spider-Army in the final confrontation against the Inheritors that saw the defeat of the hunter family.</p><p>Peter's next big challenge presented itself when Kraven the Hunter hurtled him into a hunting contest alongside various animal-themed villains held in Central Park. Accompanied by a younger clone of himself he deemed his \"son,\" Kraven's ultimate goal was to goad Spider-Man into killing him, since only dying by the Web-Slinger's had would break his undead curse. During their final confrontation, Spider-Man convinced Kraven that true strength of character was best shown through compassion and mercy. Kraven called off the hunt and donned Spider-Man's costume to die in battle against his son. Since embracing Peter's ideals turned him into Spider-Man in spirit and because his death was deliberate, therefore by his own hand, the curse allowed Kraven to remain dead.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Peter became tangled in a conflict between Venom and the resurgent Carnage, who had become the herald of the Symbiote God Knull and embarked in a journey to retrieve symbiote remnants of people, dead or alive, who had been bound to a symbiote, in order to awaken Knull from his slumber. Spider-Man helped Venom's efforts to stop Kasady, most notably protecting Brock's son Dylan and Normie Osborn from Norman Osborn, who still believed himself to be Cletus Kasady and had been bonded to a copy of the Carnage symbiote by the real Kasady and turned into a pawn. Dark Carnage's reign of terror was stopped by Venom when he murdered Kasady to save Dylan's life, albeit causing himself to absorb Kasady's composite symbiote, awakening Knull.</p><p>Kindred would finally interact directly with Peter, setting the stage by resurrecting Stanley Carter, the Sin-Eater, and sending him on a campaign of vicious vigilantism, using new abilities to strip both the powers and wickedness off super villains, leaving them with a deep repentance. Under Kindred's orders, Sin-Eater targeted the restored Norman Osborn, the new director of the Ravencroft Institute. Initially conflicted, Peter chose to save Osborn, who became the Green Goblin again to fight in his escaping Sin-Eater. With help from his spider hero friends in The Order, Peter brought Osborn to an escape pod but Osborn's antagonism caused Peter to reconsider and abandoned Norman Osborn to Sin-Eater's mercy.</p><p>With Sin-Eater purifying Osborn, Kindred had the collected sins absorbed go out to possess and corrupt the Order. Managing to evade his possessed allies, Spider-Man sought Doctor Strange's help, later using a mystic artifact to locate Kindred's home at the Osborn family cemetery. Kindred staged the corpses of lost loved ones in a macabre scene, expressing his intentions to Peter, and eventually revealing himself as Harry. Kindred continuously killed and resurrected Peter as a direct torture, then forcing him to sit at a dinner alongside Mary Jane to repent for his perceived sins, including what Peter didn't remember that allegedly turned Harry into Kindred. The event was interrupted by Norman, who allied himself with Kingpin to capture Harry in a Darkforce cage.</p><p>While Spider-Man was liberated from Kindred's clutches, Peter was shaken to his core and knew that his and Mary Jane's ordeal with Kindred wasn't truly done. While drained emotionally, Mary Jane would give him an improvised therapy session to alleviate some hurt, regaining some hope in himself.</p><p>After Peter accepted Norah's TNM job offer, granting Spider-Man a new suit enhancing his physical attributes, Spider-Man and Boomerang continued collecting Tablet fragments and moved to secure the final piece. Rescuing an abducted Randy and Janice, Spider-Man aided Robbie and Tombstone with The Syndicate in taking down Madame Masque and Crime Master. With help from his New Avengers colleagues and Black Cat delivering Fisk's fragments, Spider-Man passed the final fragment's curse test, but Fred betrayed him with help from his cohorts. Felicia returned Peter to his ruined apartment to rest, later reading Fred's note explaining his long con before the others informed him that Fisk instead revived his son, The Rose. Quitting TNM and donating his pay to Aunt May's FEAST shelter, Peter met with Betty returned home from Europe, surprised by her advanced pregnancy.</p><h2>Personality</h2><dl><dd><i>Whether a law is right or wrong, moral or immoral, is an idea, a personal philosophy... but it always seems that fights over <b>ideas</b> skip over the barrier into the real world and become battles of real violence.</i><dl><dd>--<b>Spider-Man (Peter Parker)</b></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>Spider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by Luke Cage when he felt embarrassed about Electro causing the Raft breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it. This combined with his strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel Universe.</p><p>One of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.</p><p>Behind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft and Norman Osborn's Initiative because they were \"his\" villains.</p><p>Death, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic proclamations, such as his \"Nobody dies!\" credo after Marla Madison's passing. Peter has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson, which was exacerbated by Kindred repeatedly killing and resurrecting him. Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died at the hands of Venom, Carnage, and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth.</p><p>Spider-Man is also traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the Avengers.</p><p>Peter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats like supporting the weight of a jet<sup>[344]</sup> and beating up Firelord. Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still remain in his personality.</p><p>Spider-Man's righteousness complimented Daredevil's maturity as a crime-fighter during the The Death of Jean DeWolff, leading to an enduring friendship. Peter also made close ties with the Fantastic Four at the very start of his career, which stands greater than ever today, like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally.Spider-Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member, trusting them so much that he would reveal his identity to them. Of the two previously mentioned teams, Spidey is closest to the Human Torch, playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively, and Wolverine, respectively. Peter is also quite close to the X-Men, able to sympathize with the public scorn that mutants often face,<sup>[351]</sup> and once joining their faculty - though he was quick to call them out on being prejudicial against non-mutants. Spider-Man has also developed a strong friendship with Deadpool, despite annoying each other with their morals and jokes.</p><p>Personal Data</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 167 lbs. 11.93 stones 75.75kg</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Hazel</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Brown</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Forest Hills, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Education:</b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher, Horizon Labs employee</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/richard-parker/4005-15261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15261\">Richard Parker</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"/mary-parker/4005-15262/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15262\">Mary Parker</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"/uncle-ben/4005-3114/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3114\">Benjamin Parker</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/aunt-may/4005-1780/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1780\">May Parker</a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"/amy-reilly/4005-65796/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65796\">Amy Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/amanda-reilly/4005-66173/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-66173\">Amanda Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/alexa-reilly/4005-65797/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-65797\">Alexa Reilly</a> (cousin), <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/4005-6286/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6286\">Benjamin Reilly</a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"/kaine/4005-8667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8667\">Kaine</a> (clone), <a href=\"/spidercide/4005-25666/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25666\">Spidercide</a> (clone).</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5145454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2026841\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 550w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d.jpg 422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea Tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.</p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.</p><h3>Spider-Sense</h3><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone-based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"/michele-gonzales/4005-62208/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-62208\">Michele Gonzales</a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"/daken/4005-42501/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42501\">Daken</a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course, his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"/iron-fist/4005-1492/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1492\">Iron Fist</a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired, or when he chooses to ignore it although it's difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There were also times that his spider-sense wasn't very effective due to Spidey's previous lack of formal training, but this has since has been largely rectified since learning the Way of the Spider. Under extreme circumstances, such as fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey has often used his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense also gave him his own free-style form of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe and his H2H skill has improved significantly since merging his Way of the Spider training with his Spider-Sense. Furthermore, the Spider-Sense also allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his speed and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge almost all conventional attacks. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spiders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.</p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press 10 tons without effort and much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person- Spider-Man has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength levels to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a height of much greater than three stories with one powerful jump. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with opponents including <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href=\"/venom/4005-1486/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1486\">Venom</a>, and <a href=\"/rhino/4005-2126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2126\">Rhino</a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a>. It's also shown that Spider-Man can break free from Doctor Octopus's nearly indestructible arms albeit with much effort, although this was due to the Sinister Six suit enhancing his strength. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of humans as his body produces fewer fatigue toxins. He was able to fight Morlun continually for many hours and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons without effort and after the Other story arc he was able to lift at least 20 tons without effort. During that time, he wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift over 25 tons without effort. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"/mephisto/4005-2635/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2635\">Mephisto</a> after the One More Day storyline. Spider-man's best strength feats tend to come during periods of emotional duress- for example in a fight with Iron Man 2020, where when a boy was injured mid-fight, an enraged Spider-Man jumped up to his flying height and hit him with such force the foe was sent flying hundreds of feet into a building, which was destroyed on impact. Another instance was when he lifted a segment of the Daily Bugle after the building was attacked by the Green Goblin. In both cases, he didn't have any enhancements from the Queen or the Other.</p><h3>Superhuman Speed, Agility, Flexibility, and Reflexes</h3><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility, and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. This is particularly evident over short distances. He has frequently speed-blitzed many foes- including those with enhanced speed and reflexes, moving so fast that he leaves blurring after images. He has been described as moving with the speed of machine-gun fire, moving faster than the eye can follow, and moved so fast that Daredevil (who has enhanced reflexes and senses) could barely register him, and was unable to react to a punch he was knew Spider-Man was going to land. Over longer distances, his speed seems less pronounced, but he was still able to outrun Kraven and his cheetahs (both of whom can run at over 60 mph) and has easily outrun speeding cars. However, this could be due to his preference for Web-Slinging over longer distances than due to an inability to maintain higher levels of speed over longer distances. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance, and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balancing in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even some of the most agile street-level heroes like Captain America, Daredevil, and <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are forty times greater than peak level humans, and when combined with his Spider-Sense, speed and agility, enable him to dodge bullets and other conventional projectiles with ease. During the Grim Hunt storyline, he even dodged sniper rifle fire at point-blank range after the bullet had been fired.</p><h3>Superhuman Durability</h3><p>Spider-Man also has incredible durability to blunt trauma as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand such levels of damage and punishment that would kill non-super-powered individuals. For example, he has frequently taken blows from characters with high levels of superhuman strength (Hulk, Venom, Rhino, Puma, Green Goblin, etc) without sustaining significant injury. He has also survived the force of having a building collapse on him multiple times. This durability extends to falling from great heights. For example, he was once knocked through three buildings by Mr. Negative before falling multiple stories to the ground, yet still remained conscious. His durability to blunt trauma also extends to explosive forces, and he has taken explosions with the force of a hand grenade and recovered nearly instantly in a recent fight with the Juggernaut. In the Sins Past Storyline, he tanked a building destroying explosion but was significantly weakened afterward. The toughness of Spider-Man is such that he often rolls with the blows of punches thrown by non-powered foes to avoid injuring them- when he once decided to tense his abdominal muscles against the blows of a trained boxer, the boxer broke his wrists. Scorpion once described Spider-Man's body \"as being as hard as concrete\".</p><p>However, Spider-Man's durability isn't nearly as formidable against penetrative forces. He can be hurt by knives and bullets much in the same way that normal humans can and has been rendered unconscious by a tracking bullet that pierced his shoulder. Normal bullets also tend to cause Spider-Man problems as well. When he lost his Spider-Sense and faced a villain known as Massacre who utilized multiple weaponry and traps, Spider-Man decided to make a bulletproof suit from tech at Horizon labs. However, if injured by such forces, his healing factor allows him to heal much faster than normal humans can.</p><h3>Wall Crawling</h3><p>Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established. Spider-man utilizes this ability in his locomotion across New York but also has the ability to use it offensively, in a manner resembling the Mark of Kaine. Spider-Man rarely uses this ability though, due to its brutal and disfiguring effects. It also works differently, ripping off layers of skin and muscle, rather than burning it as Kaine does via the HCL secreted through his palms.</p><h3>Organic Webbing</h3><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing, which is often shown as being stronger and more long-lasting than his synthetic variants. Spider-Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course) and 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.) Spider-Man also has organic webbing in the 2099 universe. It seems the strength of his webbing relates directly to his health.</p><h3>Superhuman Stamina</h3><p>Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for many hours before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He once fought Morlun for many hours continuously and has stated an ability to hold his breath for at least twice as long as non-enhanced humans.</p><h3>Regenerative Healing Factor</h3><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however, after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after. In another instance, he suffered multiple broken bones, trauma, and blood loss when he was defeated by the Rhino but was fine in the next issue.</p><h3>Foreign Chemical Resistance</h3><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings but recovered in less than 24 hours. In another example, he was able to recover from the effects of gases nearly instantly. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.</p><h3>Superhuman Sight</h3><p>Spider-Man also seems to have at least some degree of Super-Human sight, at least in order to assist his Superhuman speed, reflexes, and agility. Ever since obtaining his powers, he has not needed his glasses and has frequently pulled off impressive aiming feats with his webbing, although this is assisted with his Spider-Sense. Perhaps most impressively, during Spider-Island, a depowered Hercules with Spider-Man's power-set said he could see bullets in slow motion.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>On top of his spider-given powers, Peter is of genius level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Reed Richards</a> did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology, and physics. This has become particularly apparent during his time working at Horizon Labs, where he was able to create a device to drain Alpha of his powers in less than 24 hours.</p><p>He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat over the years. Spider-Man, even before his training from Shang-Chi, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert and combined with Spider-Man's reflexes and physical attributes, make it very difficult for Street-levelers to defeat him when he is not holding back.</p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider-sense. He began training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called the \"Way of the Spider\". It was then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists of among other things, hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed. This new martial art has considerably improved Spider-Man's H2H capabilities, and so far he has stalemated Julia Carpenter and effortlessly defeated 3 spider-powered individuals in a few seconds during Spider-Island. When he regained his Spider-Sense, he defeated a mutated Kaine who was considerably stronger and quicker than him and effortlessly trumped a mind-controlled Spider-Woman, in a handful of blows and kicks.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h3>Web-Shooters</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2269938650307\" data-width=\"326\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 326px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:122.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104255\"><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's web-shooters broken down\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main.jpg 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px\" data-width=\"521\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's web-shooters broken down</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man's most famous piece of equipment is his self-built <a href=\"/web-shooters/4055-42426/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-42426\">web-shooters</a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter's own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man's primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.</p><h3>Utility Belt</h3><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"../../spider-signal/18-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Signal</a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera, and his mask when not in costume.</p><h3>Camera</h3><p>Spider-Man possesses his father's automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man's chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/65-40822/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Daily Bugle</a>.</p><h3>Spider-Tracer</h3><p>The <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Tracer</a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100-mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.</p><h3>Mask</h3><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man's colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.</p><h3>Spider-Mobile</h3><p>The <a href=\"/spider-mobile/4055-15441/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-15441\">Spider-Mobile</a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"/human-torch/4005-2120/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2120\">Johnny Storm</a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"/mysterio/4005-4333/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4333\">Mysterio</a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"/tinkerer/4005-3144/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3144\">Tinkerer</a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.</p><h3>Equipment since working at Horizon Labs</h3><p>At Horizons Labs, the combination of a well-paying job and access to numerous tech has allowed Peter to expand on the equipment he uses. So far he has developed a Spider-Glider, Thermodynamic Foam, Cryo Pellets, voice-activated web-shooters, and various types of webbing, including magnetic and acidic variants. Many of the equipment have a usage in day-to-day usage as well- for example, the cryo pellet technology was used to help keep organs and limbs viable for longer periods of time. The Thermodynamic foam also has used in the stopping and prevention of fires.</p><h3>Spider-bots</h3><p>Dock ock created specific spectators who keep watch of new york, saving spider-mans the trouble to patrol.</p><h2>Costumes</h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well-known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume, and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man's costumes in his costume gallery.</p><p>It is Spider-Man's original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man's essential traits. During Spidey's early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrunk and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.</p><h3>Black Suit</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5125\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-100577\"><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Black Suit\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px\" data-width=\"423\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Black Suit</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/4045-40978/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40978\">Secret Wars</a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it, he had an unlimited supply of webbing, and the suit could mimic his civilian clothing. It didn't, contrary to popular belief, enhance his powers. After meeting with Mr. Fantastic, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"/kravens-last-hunt/4045-43327/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43327\">Kraven's last Hunt</a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man's heart like never before. He wore the black costume to show this dark side, becoming much more ruthless towards enemies (using torture for example). Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter's \"brother\" Kaine. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"/spider-girl/4005-40598/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40598\">Arana</a>. The black suit represents Spider-Man's dark side.</p><h3>Iron Spider suit</h3><p><strong>See: <a href=\"/iron-spider-costume/4055-55797/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55797\">Iron Spider Costume</a></strong></p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5075\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-230136\"><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Spider\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 424px) 100vw, 424px\" data-width=\"424\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Spider</figcaption></figure><p>After the \" <a href=\"/spider-man-the-other/4045-43776/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-43776\">Other</a>\" story arc, Tony Stark designed for Peter a specialized Red &amp; Gold costume that is similar to Tony Stark's Iron Man costume. It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small-caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he's worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice-activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while. He had already known about this and used his computer expertise to disable the override and managed to defeat Iron Man with a surprise attack. He then discarded the costume and returned to wear his original costume when he joined Captain America's team during the Civil War. The members of the initiative team known as the <a href=\"../../scarlet-spiders/65-44648/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scarlet Spiders</a> would start wearing costumes of similar design and functions.</p><h3>Spider Armor</h3><p><b>See: <a href=\"/spider-armor/4055-57037/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-57037\">Spider-Armor</a></b></p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ratio=\"1.3493449781659\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285272\"><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spiderman armor\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285272-spider_armor.gif 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spiderman armor</figcaption></figure><p>While in an ESU laboratory, Peter invented a white &amp; blue suit that was made of steel plates that were from a pseudo-metallic composition using a modified webbing formula.

Orange is for the secondary mode which disrupts sonic frequencies from infrasonic to ultrasonic but is visible. Blue is in normal mode which can be seen and heard. However, a side effect of this costume is that while he can be impervious to sonic attacks, it also prevents him from hearing others. For example, while fighting the Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, Spider-Man was unable to hear the Cat's cries for help.</p><h3>Future Foundation Costume</h3><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"2.4148471615721\" data-width=\"229\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 229px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:241.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2285302\"><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/7/70123/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px\" data-width=\"229\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey's costume upon joining The Future Foundation</figcaption></figure><p>When Peter joined The Future Foundation he was given a new costume by <a href=\"/invisible-woman/4005-2190/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2190\">Sue Storm</a>.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC on September 9, 1967, and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City university, while witnessing a radiology experiment that would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider's leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter's first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had run past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn't really care at the time and didn't help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben's death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle's murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime-fighter protecting New York.</p><p>Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson.</p><p>This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there's a hang-up, you'll find the Spider-Man!\"</p><h4>Spider-Man (1978)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.96333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:96.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2164020\"><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/114254/2164020-original.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Japanese Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel's famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Japan</a>.

This version's character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"../../john-romita/26-7499/\" rel=\"nofollow \">John Romita</a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid-60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a college student who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as Peter's Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson's secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"../../robbie-robertson/29-1782/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Robbie Robertson</a>, Jameson's assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and the Chameleon. This also included a six-part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.</p><h4><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends </a>(1981)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981, and lasted through September 10, 1983. This would be the third animated adventure for Spidey which would end up being more popular than its previous series Spider-Man, which ended the same year this new show would start. After Spider-Man in 1981, NBC wanted to take Spider-Man on a different route that would appeal to more audiences. In this series, Marvel adds <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow \">X-Men's</a> Iceman and adds a new superhero named <a href=\"../../firestar/29-2101/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Firestar</a>. She gave Peter Parker a room that turned into a secret superhero hi-tech headquarters. This would change the title of the show to Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends. This series would add new villains only for this show and also have superhero team-ups throughout the series. They would fight some old enemies such as Doctor Octopus, <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Scorpion</a>, Green Goblin, Kraven the Hunter, <a href=\"../../swarm/29-1945/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Swarm</a>, Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Kingpin of Crime, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Shocker</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Sandman</a>, <a href=\"../../beetle/29-4836/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Beetle</a>, and other Marvel enemies such as Doctor Doom, Magneto, <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Loki</a>, <a href=\"../../mordred/29-19961/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mordred</a>, the Red Skull, and the <a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Juggernaut</a>.

For the second season of this show the title would be changed to \"The Incredible Hulk And The Amazing Spider-Man.\" This second would be for an hour show that would feature 30 minutes of Spidey and friends and 30 minutes of Hulk. The third season of this show would then be reversed to \"The Amazing Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk.\" This would be the last season and would also still revolve around Spider-Man and his friends.

The cartoon revolved around a 19-year-old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire State University. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy/Black Cat and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much-anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.68181818181818\" data-width=\"352\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 352px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-179794\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 352w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</figcaption></figure><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water-based and was made for <a href=\"../../hydro-man/29-4457/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Hydro-Man</a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Madame Webb</a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel's popular superhero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him, however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world. He is astounded at the fact of being an international symbol in our world, and before he leaves, he meets with the man who created him, Stan Lee.</p><h4><a href=\"/spiderman-unlimited/4075-128/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-128\">Spider-Man Unlimited </a>(1999)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.805\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1659100\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man Unlimited</figcaption></figure><p>This series debuted on Fox on October 2, 1999, and lasted through March 31, 2001. Spider-Man, in this series, was voiced by Rino Romano (making him the only voice actor to play both Spider-Man and Batman, the most-recognized characters from both DC and Marvel). This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ's son, <a href=\"/john-jameson/4005-4456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4456\">John Jameson</a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man-made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \"<a href=\"/counter-earth/4020-54572/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-54572\">Counter Earth</a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take-off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Nick Fury</a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson.</p><p>Once on \"Counter Earth\", after almost being burned up on entry, Peter is under arrest and is sought out by <a href=\"../../lord-tyger/29-23429/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Lord Tyger</a> and the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary</a>.

They are under the leadership of the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow \">High Evolutionary</a>, are stronger, faster, and free of the primitive human mind.

Peter then realizes what Venom was talking about when he said that he is going to take away the person who means the most to him.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/4075-18/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-18\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a> (2012)</h4><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533831\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.61091549295775\" data-width=\"568\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 568px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2533831\"><img alt=\"Spider-Man in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 568w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spider-Man in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 568w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/9/93477/2533831-avengersspidey.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spider-Man in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man first appears in the episode <i>Along Came A spider</i> where he helps Captain America fight the serpent society He next appears in <i>New Avengers</i> where he leads the New lineup of Avengers against Kang...after the victory and return of the Original Avengers, he officially becomes a member (although a reserve one).

The game involves climbing a skyscraper, rescuing hostages, and defusing bombs set by the Green Goblin. The 1990s saw a flood of Spider-Man Video Games. The first game of the decade released was <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b>, a puzzle action game released for Amiga, PC: DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b> was released in 1990 for the Game Boy.

Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original storylines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Maximum Carnage</a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety</b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo, and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire</b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of the rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. However, in 1995 he made his fighting game debut in Capcom's<strong> Marvel Super Heroes</strong> arcade game (which was later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn). He returned for the 1997 sequel <strong>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</strong> (which later ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn) and its 1998 followup, <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes </strong>(which was later ported to the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\" data-ratio=\"0.69849246231156\" data-width=\"597\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 597px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6395441\"><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"X-Men: Mutant Academy 2\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 597w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/6395441-mutant.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>X-Men: Mutant Academy 2</figcaption></figure><p>Not until 2000 would Spider-Man return in his own game. Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, as a character in a fighting game and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man</b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>Spider-Man</b>, developed by Neversoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year but lacked the full motion cut scenes due to the hardware of the system. Spider-Man was also one of the playable characters in the arcade game <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes </strong>(which later was released on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Xbox). In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</b> as a hidden character. In 2001, sequels to the successful Activision titles were released. <b>Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro</b> for the PlayStation and <b>Spider-Man 2: Sinister Six</b> for the Gameboy Color. Spider-Man made an early appearance on Nintendo's new handheld system, the Gameboy Advance with <b>Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace</b>.

It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox, and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"../../spider-man-2/223-42/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 2</a> was released in June 2004, <strong>Spider-Man 2: The Game</strong> was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic-related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>Ultimate Spider-Man</b> followed many of the comic story arcs and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</strong> and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dum Dum Dugan</a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow \">A.I.M</a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider, and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man's latest film, <a href=\"../../spider-man-3/223-54/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Spider-Man 3</a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3</b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP, and PC. <strong>Spider-Man: Friend or Foe</strong> was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2, PC, PSP, and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.</p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey's Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player's can dictate Spider-Man's actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Luke Cage</a>, Mary Jane, and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, Xbox, Xbox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in <strong>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</strong> and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.</p><p>Spidey's next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in the first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing are crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin, and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end, you battle an immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75111111111111\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862583\"><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spidey in action\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 450w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/49076/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spidey in action</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man once again featured as a playable fighter in the 2011 release of <strong>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</strong> and its updated release of <strong>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</strong> and versions of the game would be released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and Xbox 360. October 2011 also saw the release of the next Spider-Man video game adventure with <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time</b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free rein after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O'Hara. A new villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter's death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple dangers, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex. Currently, Beenox has been given rights to the creation of all future Spider-Man games.</p><figure data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.94272727272727\" data-width=\"1100\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1100px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4094504\"><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 1100w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/4094504-2777865209-53618.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 suit for Avengers Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>Spider-Man is an unlockable character in the Facebook game <b>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</b>.

They moved into the Xavier Mansion (the later <a href=\"/xavier-institute/4060-40473/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-40473\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>) in Westchester, New York. Cain was a bully to his stepbrother Charles, partly due to the fact that his father favored him over Cain. Unknown to Cain, Charles was succeeding because of his mutant ability to read minds, including Cain's. When he found out, Cain would never forgive Charles for this. During an argument with his father, Cain accidentally started a fire in his father's lab, the fire soon grew out of control and Kurt once again showed his preference for Charles when he saved him first.

Charles and the world believed Cain to be dead, however, Cain was buried under the rubble of the immense mountain that covered the whole temple. The Juggernaut was not stopped by this and thanks to his ability to not eat or breathe, and his recently acquired unlimited superhuman strength and durability, he dug himself out of a trillion tons of rocks that fell on him. It took Juggernaut XX years (sliding timescale) to get out to the surface with nothing but thoughts of revenge against his step-brother on his mind. This event, undoubtedly, represents one of first daunting feats of Juggernaut's strength.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Juggernaut was created by writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/4040-5614/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-5614\">Jack Kirby</a>, the same creative team responsible for the creation of the original X-Men itself.

By this time, Charles had a team of mutants, the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/x-men/4060-3173/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3173\">X-Men</a>. In spite of not being able to stop the Juggernaut, they manage to remove his helmet in the first encounter, thus allowing Charles to subdue him. After the fight with the X-Men, and unknown to the team, Professor X locked Juggernaut in a special chamber of the mansion's sub-basement. He was trying to find a way to take away Cain's powers. During the experiment, Professor X was hit by some energy feedback and was knocked unconscious, which also transferred some of his mental powers to Juggernaut. The X-Men then contacted <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, since Juggernaut's origin was magical in origin, and he told them to go to Cyttorak temple since the apparent prototype Crimson Gem of Cyttorak was there. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/cyclops/4005-1459/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1459\">Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> went into the actual Crimson Cosmos to retrieve it. The second gem succeeded in waking up Professor X, and when Juggernaut touched the second gem it sent him to the Crimson Cosmos. Xavier didn't want Cain to suffer such a fate though, and so built a machine that would slowly bring Cain back to Earth. By the time he had come back to Earth, Xavier was apparently dead (it was actually the mutant <a href=\"/morph/4005-12547/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12547\">Changeling</a>), and Juggernaut tried to beat the truth out of the X-Men as to where his brother's whereabouts were, suspecting a trap. However, the machine's effect wore off and Cain went back to the Crimson Cosmos again.</p><h3>Trapped in a Dimension</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298038\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.77164502164502\" data-width=\"924\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 924px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298038\"><img alt=\"Teamed up against the army\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 924w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Teamed up against the army\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 924w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298038-incredible_hulk_1974_%23172_12%20teamed-up.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Teamed up against the army</figcaption></figure><p>While in the Crimson Cosmos, Juggernaut managed to pick up some magical skills. In this time, Juggernaut burst into <a href=\"/nightmare/4005-2646/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2646\">Nightmare’s</a> realm and ended up saving <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange</a> when he needed his help to defeat a Nightmare, who had managed to control the cosmic powers of <a href=\"/eternity/4005-11332/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11332\">Eternity</a> in order to obliterate the planet Earth. However, Juggernaut accidentally freed Eternity, who then banished him to yet another dimension, called <a href=\"/oblivion/4005-2496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2496\">Oblivion</a>. In Oblivion, time moved faster than normal, making people age quicker there. The only antidote to which is pure hatred, which Cain had plenty. Juggernaut managed to cross over to Earth eventually, where he fought <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a>. When Beast took off Juggernaut's helmet, Juggernaut began to fear being defeated more than his hatred. He sudden aged rapidly, and so went back to Oblivion to speed up his remaining lifespan. The dimension itself had tired of Juggernaut, and so offered to him that if he gave up the magic skills he had learned in the Crimson Cosmos, he could be sent back to Earth. Naturally Juggernaut agreed, and materialized right in the middle of a fight between the <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> and the U.S. Army. The two teamed up, but when Hulk saw Juggernaut endangering innocent lives, he fought against him. During the battle, the Juggernaut's physical power seemingly had the advantage over Hulk in terms of raw strength and durability to the point he got on Hulk's back and almost broke his neck; however, Hulk managed to grab Juggernaut's helmet and began to spin him around so fast that it took off, sending the Juggernaut to crash into the corner of a mountain. Disconcerted by what happened, the Hulk moves away but the Juggernaut stands up quickly and gets to ready to attack him until the X-Men arrived and Professor X used his telepathic powers to put Juggernaut down due that he had lost his helmet during the fight.</p><h3>Black Tom</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134781\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3475\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-134781\"><img alt=\"A dark old friend\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A dark old friend\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" data-width=\"474\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A dark old friend</figcaption></figure><p>Whilst in prison, Juggernaut befriended fellow cell mate <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/4005-4568/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4568\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, as both had a member of the X-Men who was family and they both hated. The two were freed from jail by <a href=\"/eric-the-red/4005-13360/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13360\">Eric the Red</a>, and they set up something of a base in Cassidy Keep. <a href=\"/banshee/4005-9708/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9708\">Banshee</a> and the X-Men went to Cassidy Keep for a holiday shortly afterwards, and were easily beaten by Juggernaut and Black Tom. Eventually the fight went to the top of the keep, where Banshee managed to beat Black Tom by throwing him off the battlements. Juggernaut ignored the X-Men as he lept into the water to save his friend. Juggernaut did succeed in saving Tom, and the two returned to attacking the X-Men shortly afterwards.</p><p>The duo decided to hire <a href=\"/arcade/4005-8429/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8429\">Arcade</a> to take down the X-Men, despite Juggernaut being against it, but Arcade didn't do any better than they did.

What's more, they had to fight local hero <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/spider-woman/4005-1453/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1453\">Spider-Woman</a> as well. Juggernaut and Black Tom agreed that if they ever wanted to defeat the X-Men they'd need another ally, and decided on <a href=\"/madame-web/4005-10670/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10670\">Madame Web</a> since she could predict their opponent's moves. Juggernaut went after Madame Web, but when he pulled her out of her life-supporting chair in his eagerness, she almost died. <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> managed to defeat Juggernaut by luring him into some wet cement of a concrete foundation, which he sunk through to the bottom. It took Juggernaut a month to come up of the surface, which he did by digging into the bedrock through of hundreds of thousands cubic meters of rock, clay, and stone compacted over his body.</p><h3>Back in Town</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1255531\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.51602023608769\" data-width=\"593\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 593px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1255531\"><img alt=\"Colossus was knocked out!!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Colossus was knocked out!!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 593w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/1255531-uxm183pg19.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Colossus was knocked out!!</figcaption></figure><p>The first thing Juggernaut did once he was out of the cement was enter his favourite bar for a drink. Whilst he did so, a dark-haired woman approached him and started flirting heavily with him. Juggernaut was unaware that this woman was the immortal <a href=\"/selene/4005-2176/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2176\">Selene</a>, who was planning to drain Juggernaut's energy as her next victim. Before she could complete her plan, <a href=\"/colossus/4005-1460/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1460\">Colossus</a>, who was coincidentally in the same bar, accidentally spilled his drink over Juggernaut. Juggernaut and Colossus got into a fight, with Juggernaut easily being the victor. When he saw the rest of the X-Men though, he gave them some money to cover the damages then left.</p><p>For Black Tom's birthday, Juggernaut gave him the <a href=\"/crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/4055-41533/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-41533\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a> which had originally granted him his powers. When Tom touched the gift he transformed into a second Juggernaut, although both him and Cain had only half the power Cain had when he was the only Juggernaut. Cain and Tom had a short fight which was soon interrupted by Spider-Man and the X-Men; they managed to defeat the Juggernauts by having Rogue drain Tom's powers, which then went to Cain when he touched the Crimson Gem a second time. Juggernaut escaped with Tom and in case of someone else draining his power by touching the gem, Juggernaut threw it into space so that no one could get it.</p><p>While perusing a scheme in Scotland with Black Tom, Cain came across <a href=\"/dazzler/4005-1498/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1498\">Dazzler</a>. Wanting to prove herself, she took Juggernaut on thinking him another \"strong guy\". Cain didn't want the fight as he was a fan of Dazzler - having brought all her albums and even seen her live; however Alison continued to attack although nothing she did had any effect on Juggernaut and she passed out from exertion. Cain thought he had killed her and gave her a decent burial, which the X-Men then had to dig her out from as she was only unconscious.</p><h3>Acts of Vengeance</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1516373\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.64\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1516373\"><img alt=\"Hammer ride!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hammer ride!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33150/1516373-juggernaut14.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hammer ride!</figcaption></figure><p>During Acts of Vengeance, Juggernaut was pitted against <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/thor/4005-2268/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2268\">Thor</a> by <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/loki/4005-4324/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4324\">Loki</a>.

Onslaught’s massive psionic assault weakened Juggernaut's mind before magnetically throwing him out from Canada to the wilds to outside NYC. Found by the X-Men, Cain recovered in their infirmary. Once better, he escaped before he could tell the X-Men who Onslaught was. Eventually, Cain headed back to Xavier's where he went to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> helmet-less to prove he wanted her to sort out his jumbled memories of who Onslaught was. Using the mysterious Z'Nok chamber, Jean made the discovery that Onslaught was Charles Xavier and told Cain to run. In that moment, Onslaught caught Juggernaut and told him that he can not kill him because he is indestructible, as long as he stays bounded and protected by the power of the mystical energy of Cyttorak. However, Onslaught handled Cain’s magic links with Cyttorak to restrict his powers only by locking him inside the Gem. Thus Onslaught created a massive psionic display where he appears ripping the Gem of Cyttorak from Cain's chest.</p><p>Cain stripped of his powers, was tossed into <a href=\"/crimson-cosmos/4020-60354/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-60354\">Crimson Cosmos</a>, where he would be the perfect sacrifice that would lead the release of the most destructive and evil aspect of Cyttorak on the Earth again. However, a pair of sorcerers called <a href=\"/gomurr-the-ancient/4005-24823/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24823\">Gomurr</a> and <a href=\"/tar/4005-9378/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9378\">Tar</a> entered in the unattended Gem and attempted to take its powers for themselves, but they were opposed by the Juggernaut and a demoness called <a href=\"/spite/4005-24948/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24948\">Spite</a>, who is the sister of <a href=\"/dspayre/4005-42543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42543\">D’Spayre</a>. Juggernaut soon realizes that Spite just wanted to use him as a sacrifice to Cyttorak, at that time Cyttorak swallows Spite and gets ready to ram against Cain. However, the sorcerers join their forces to bind back the Juggernaut with Cyttorak’s Gem which allows him to gain the power to defeat the Cyttorak’s most destructive aspect. Cain was sent back to Earth, in Sirocco Sprawl, New Mexico, where Spite and D’Spayre again, attempted to involve him in their sibling rivalry, but Cain drove them off and saved the town who declared the Juggernaut their savior.</p><h3>The All New Exiles</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298134\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3432098765432\" data-width=\"810\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 810px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:134.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298134\"><img alt=\"With Amber\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 810w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 714w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"With Amber\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 810w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 714w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298134-all%20new%20exiles.v1.001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>With Amber</figcaption></figure><p>During the events occurred in Onslaught storyline, Juggernaut had awakened inside the X-Mansion.

Cyttorak's item was the Crimson Gem and Cain had touched it, making him the Exemplar of Physical Strength. The last totem was activated stating the Octessence where the Eight Exemplar's would battle until only one remained. The Exemplar's would each lead one eighth of the world’s population into battle after removing all will power from Humanity with the God-machine located in the North Pole. However, Cain objected this plan and given he'd had decades as Juggernaut, withstanding his destructive path, he drove out Cyttorak’s influence and had the intention to smash the God-machine. While the Avengers had been captured by the Exemplars, the Juggernaut refused to be part of the wager of the Octessence, so after struggling in his mind and get out of the Cyttorak's influence, he managed to release them and then he defeated <a href=\"/bedlam/4005-13717/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13717\">Bedlam</a>, <a href=\"/decay/4005-101777/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-101777\">Decay</a>, <a href=\"/conquest/4005-19945/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-19945\">Conquest</a>, <a href=\"/carnivore/4005-13723/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13723\">Carnivore</a> and <a href=\"/stonecutter/4005-13721/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13721\">Stonecutter</a>, besides he destroyed the God-Machine, saving the world from losing the will.</p><h3>Joining the X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305694\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-305694\"><img alt=\"As an X-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"As an X-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>As an X-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Cain's rebellion against Cyttorak had serious consequences for Cain as he began to lose the mystical energies that flowed through him. Cain behaviour began to change drastically, perhaps because those energies were evil they where influencing his behaviour as the Juggernaut. With that influence gone, Cain became noticeably different. When Black Tom had a secondary mutation into a plant-like being, Cain called the X-Men to help when his friend attacked him. Not only that but he actually was willing to let himself drown because Tom had rejected him. Cain was saved by Sammy aka Squidboy, a recent recruit to the Xavier Institute school. Cain decided to look at his life and in the process, he reconciled with his step-brother. Charles and Cain discussed their shared history; Cain was a constant victim of his father's temper and hated Charles for not using his power to stop him, but unknown to Cain was that Charles was also a victim and didn't use his powers because he was scared to.</p><p>Cain officially joined the X-Men in Havok's team. While at the Xavier mansion, almost none of the X-Men wanted Cain there and some even tried to force him out, however Cain stayed and partly due to the strong friendship with Sammy. Knowing Sammy's family issues, Cain commented that he saw himself when he looked at Sammy. Their friendship was such that when Sammy was forced home by his family Cain flew to Canada to check on him even getting into a fight with Alpha Flight.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3733900\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.64674868189807\" data-width=\"1138\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1138px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3733900\"><img alt=\"Famous one night stand between Juggernaut and She-Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 1138w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Famous one night stand between Juggernaut and She-Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 1138w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/126982/3733900-sj1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Famous one night stand between Juggernaut and She-Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>Cain was arrested and She-Hulk came north to represent him which after Cain stopped a prison break turned into a romance and one night stand.

Sammy, not aware of what Juggernaut was doing, stumbled upon a group meeting and was devastated that Cain would betray everyone.

Nocturne had displayed some romantic feelings for Cain, especially during her stroke recovery, but Cain was not sure how to return them, especially as Cain was suffering from depression due to his loss of power. The situation was brought home when the Wrecking Crew beat him up in London laughing at him having become a joke and the other villains had taken him off their mobile phone and Christmas card lists. Wrecker told him he had abandoned his 'brother' Black Tom.</p><p>The Crew's words to him led Cain to consider his weakened state, which made Cain to travel to Korea and the Temple of Cyttorak. In doing so, Cain discovered that it was never Cyttorak's intention to use Cain as his avatar, but the true target was his brother Charles Xavier. Cain was upset about the fact that it was meant for Charles and not him, especially as it seemed Cyttorak thought him a failure. He asked Cyttorak why he wanted Cain back as was told that being Juggernaut was the one thing Cain has not failed at. Being the Avatar of Strength the destruction he spread was exactly what Cyttorak wanted. Cain fought another possible Juggernaut to for the right to claim the Gem, as to become the Juggernaut, one has to kill the current holder of the power. Only when one was dead could one of them take the Gem and the power. Excalibur came to take him home before he landed the killing blow and Cyttorak explained the history of his Avatar's and what Cain had done to claim his power; the team walked out in disgust- although Nocturne seemed more interested in what they had going, but this moment seemed to be their split. Cain told Excalibur he had not taken the Gem, but it was shown he had it secretly in his possession. Pete Wisdom told Cain he was still on the team as what he said went and he understood what it was like to have horrible things in one's past.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298255\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.55234375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298255\"><img alt=\"Juggernaut vs World War Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 618w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 412w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Juggernaut vs World War Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 618w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298255-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0025%20jugg%20beats%20hulk.jpg 412w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 412px) 100vw, 412px\" data-width=\"412\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Juggernaut vs World War Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>Cain might had built a life with Nocturne and Excalibur but during Hulk's return to Earth ( World War Hulk) the green giant attacked the X Mansion. Excalibur were too far away to help. However Cain pulled out the Gem and agreed to do Cyttorak's bidding again if he would get Cain to the Hulk. Cyttorak transports Cain to the Mansion where he is beaten by <a href=\"/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> who claims Cain is 'wimpier' than he last saw him. Confused as to why he did not have his powers, Cyttorak informed him that he was restricting the power flow by lying to himself about why he wanted it - he didn't want it to save his brother as he said- he wanted it for himself and to prove he was not a wimp and loser. After he accepts this ,and what taking back Cyttorak's power and status means, he engaged the Hulk again. In this fight, Cain fully powered, was able to knock him down with one punch in his jaw, stomped and harmed the Hulk, making him spit blood, until finally, shoulder to shoulder, with their hands locked up, they began to push each other in a test of strength. Juggernaut started to push back the Hulk who was forced to accept he could not stop the Juggernaut's forward motion; so Hulk outsmarted Cain and suddenly released his hold and sidestepped him when <a href=\"/professor-x/4005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1505\">Charles Xavier</a> did distract Cain by yelling out him that if he kept pushing back the Hulk the whole mansion would collapse; this caused Juggernaut to continue moving forward and with added push in his back he ran violently until finally crashed into a lake nearby, being himself removed from the battlefield. Hulk then sorted things out with Charles and left the mansion.</p><p>After the battle Charles thanked his step-brother for coming to the rescue. Juggernaut told him it was not for him and gave him a message that the others should not seek him out as they would not like what they found. During the Manifest Destiny storyline, Juggernaut was in a bar contemplating whether to be a good guy or a bad guy, while asking those in the bar their advice. After the local police fired on him without stopping to see who he was first, Juggernaut thrashed them and decided that he was \"good with the bad\".</p><h3>Back to Evil?</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084646\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.83053040103493\" data-width=\"773\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 773px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084646\"><img alt=\"Punching Charles\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 773w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Punching Charles\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 773w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/54697/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Punching Charles</figcaption></figure><p>Some weeks later, Juggernaut held a bar hostage waiting for Charles Xavier to meet him. Cain possibly killing a bar patron at random to get Charles to sit down. They have a brief discussion on the origin of the word \"Juggernaut\" and Charles tells Cain he knows hes channeling the full power of Cyttorak again but its not too late. Cain tells Charles that he is going to kill him so he does not live his life following Charles. Charles gives Cain a box that is to be opened after his death, which Juggernaut proceeds to bring about. After the murder Juggernaut goes on with his life as he always has; robbing banks, fighting the X-Men etc. Until he decides to open the box and sees himself lying in bed sleeping. It was all an illusion. Xavier was in his head the entire time. He did this for the simple fact that he knew Cain would kill him if he appeared in person.</p><h3>Fighting Skaar</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298277\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.53515625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298277\"><img alt=\"Knocking down Skaar\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Knocking down Skaar\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298277-3226834-juggs%2B1skaar.jpg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Knocking down Skaar</figcaption></figure><p>When Banner wanted Skaar to train for the battle with Hulk, he used a satellite in order to destroy Juggernaut's home in Arizona. That made Juggernaut angry so he tracked Banner and Skaar immediately. When they met each other Banner explained why he did it, but Skaar didn't want to fight Cain, so he left Banner for him to play with. Juggernaut punched Banner so hard that he caused giant earthquakes nearby, and despite of the fact Banner had his Bannertech shield up, he still felt the pain of those tremendous blows. Then Skaar interrupted their fight and the battle between him and Juggernaut began. Skaar made one successful hit, but the rest of the battle was definitely not in his favor. Juggernaut rained powerful blows one after another, until Skaar was brutally knocked down. Using his <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/old-power/12-55874/\">Old Power</a> Skaar reverted back to his child form, which temporarily stopped Juggernaut from landing hits on him (because Skaar was begging Juggernaut not to hit him again), then with Juggernaut distracted by Banner, he didn't notice that Skaar changed back to his Hulk form. Skaar ran and smacked Juggernaut high into the air by using his Old Power. They continued to battle in the sky, until they landed in a large chasm with lava flowing deep in the bottom. Skaar made Juggernaut think that they're on the same side, as both of them hated Banner. They teamed up and were flying on a giant rock out of the chasm, but in the end Skaar tricked Juggernaut again and pushed him from behind, so Juggernaut fell from the rock and while he was landing, Skaar used Old Power to punch Juggernaut into orbit, removing him from the battlefield.</p><h3>Captain Universe Powers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210374\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4521028037383\" data-width=\"856\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 856px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210374\"><img alt=\"As Captain Universe\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 856w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 661w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 440w\"><noscript><img alt=\"As Captain Universe\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 856w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 661w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1210374-captain_juggernaut001.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\" data-width=\"440\"></noscript></a><figcaption>As Captain Universe</figcaption></figure><p>Juggernaut was shown to have a serious encounter with new Captain Universe and he also met his old foe, Spider-man, again. After landing into the one of Manhattan's parks, he was found by Spider-man and then by police,who delivered him into the Inwood Armory in the Upper Manhattan. Spider-man found Juggernaut and asked him who did it to him. Juggernaut described the appearance of the attacker, when suddenly the one they were talking about appeared - Captain Universe; his current host an unknown. He attacked Spider-man and then threw the platform with Juggernaut into the Jersey Palisades. While Spider-man took care of Captain Universe, Juggernaut woke up and took out two policemen nearby. Noticing that his helmet was destroyed, he created another by using the Crimson Magic. He found Spider-man blinded, and despite Spider-man's worst expectations, he didn't kill him but freed him. Suddenly, Captain Universe appeared again, wanting the revenge on the Juggernaut.</p><p>However, this time he was not so lucky as before and Juggernaut quickly handled him and was about to land a finishing blow. Spider-man said Juggernaut not kill Captain Universe, but the latter took advantage of Cain's distraction and teleported them both to an unearthly realm. There he reveals his story and true identity to Juggernaut. In fact, the host was an office worker, William Nguyen, whose life was ruined when Spider-man and Juggernaut busted through the building where he worked. William was chosen by Enigma Force in order to collect all wrongs in the world, so he decided to start with Juggernaut. He knew that once the Juggernaut starts moving, he cannot be stopped , so he decided to take Juggernaut by surprise, grabbing him from behind and flying with him in the orbit. He tried to use a mental assault on Juggernaut, but his helmet was an impediment. So William blew it up and threw him back to Earth. After telling this story, Juggernaut wanted to fight Captain Universe again, now in a fair fight. William teleported them back to Earth. While his original purpose was to repair tectonic plates that were damaged by Juggernaut, he decided to kill Juggernaut first, leading to the disappointment of Enigma Force. The repair must have been done, and for that Captain Universe is needed. Absolutely surprisingly, Juggernaut became the new Captain Universe. Enigma Force chose him to repair the damage he did long time ago.</p><p>After fulfilling his purpose, Enigma Force left the Juggernaut and disappeared. So did the Juggernaut, after apologizing Nguyen for that accident.</p><p>Despite Luke Cage's apprehensions, the executives of the Thunderbolt initiative decided it would be an asset to their team to have Juggernaut be a part of it. Marko is eager to join and escape his cell on The Raft, but has thus far shown to be insubordinate to Cage, Songbird, and the other staffers of the team. It has also been pointed out several times that Juggernaut's powers are greatly diminished, being able</p><p>to be controlled by nanites and shown to be extremely vulnerable to physical attacks, all this because his links with Cyttorak’s energies were disrupted after Marko took possession of the Uni-Power’s energies temporarily when he became the Captain Universe's host. In punishment, Juggernaut was depowered by Cyttorak .</p><h3>Fear Itself</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797379\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2965571205008\" data-width=\"1278\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1797379\"><img alt=\"Kuurth - Breaker of Stone\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 1278w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 740w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 493w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Kuurth - Breaker of Stone\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 1278w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 740w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/57845/1797379-chosen001.jpg 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" data-width=\"493\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kuurth - Breaker of Stone</figcaption></figure><p>In the Fear Itself arc, Juggernaut becomes one of the 'worthy'.

The hammer transforms him into one of The Worthy, and he becomes Kuurth - Breaker of Stone. With a single massive hammer strike, the newly empowered Juggernaut smashes the entire prison seemingly in half.</p><p>With Kuurth now in complete control of Cain's body and mind, he flew away from The Raft and began tearing his way across the middle United States, specifically Missouri. Upon reaching the town of Salem, he briefly found himself in conflict with Speedball and was thrown out of town by his kinetic abilities. However, this did nothing to harm Kuurth, only enrage him to the point that he split Salem in half but not in the same way he had with The Raft.</p><p>Kuurth moved on after his short conflict with Speedball and ran into Cain Marko's old teammates, The Thunderbolts, out in Chicago before moving onto the city of Las Vegas, Nevada where the only opponents standing between him and the total annihilation of the city were The Heavy Hitters, the ex-Fifty State Initiative team that once represented Nevada. Unfortunately, none of them were able to live up to their team name and failed to stop Kuurth at each and every single turn.</p><p>Even the explosive sacrifice of Hardball, the traitor-hero of The Initiative, failed to harm Kuurth in the slightest, serving no other purpose than to temporarily hinder Kuurth's journey. After emerging from the ruins of the storm drains, Kuurth continued onward to San Francisco. Kuurth arrived near a gas station 60 miles outside of San Francisco which he destroyed, the attendant who was working there begged Kuurth not to kill him, which he did not under the condition that he come with Kuurth and act as his translator.

Upon hearing this information, Cyclops decides it is time to speak with Kuurth about his deal, but as Cyclops is about to agree to destroying the human population the city, Colossus charges through a portal as the new Juggernaut, and battles Kuurth-Juggernaut.</p><p>As Colossus fights Kuurth, he realises that he is outmatched in strength and speed. But Colossus, now a Juggernaut, knows that Kuurth cannot stop him. Kuurth is being pushed faster and faster by the unstoppable Colossus, until his master submits and the God of Fear teleports Kuurth out of the battle. San Francisco is safe from the Kuurth-Juggernaut, but there is a new Juggernaut now. Cain along with the rest of the Worthy battled with the Serpent and the combine forces of the Avengers and the Mighty Thor kill the Serpent. Cain's hammer, Stonebreaker was whisked away from him and returned to it's original landing spot at the Raft, while Cain, now ousted by Cyttorak, was was depowered.</p><h3>X-Men Disassembled</h3><p>Juggernaut, resurfaced as part of the reformed Brotherhood of Mutants. When he discovered that Joseph impersonated Magneto, he left the team and rejoined the X-Men. On a mission against the Hellfire Club, Magik was wounded to the point her demonic side was able to take over. Juggernaut jumped into action but she stole his Cyttorak power and tossed him into Limbo.</p><h3>Dawn of X</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8044166\" data-ratio=\"0.89783593356819\" data-width=\"1987\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1987px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8044166\"><img alt=\"New harness\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 1987w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"New harness\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 1987w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/124259/8044166-rco008_1605720847.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>New harness</figcaption></figure><p>By the time Juggernaut fought his way out of Limbo, his brother, Xavier, had already tamed <a href=\"/krakoa/4005-26409/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-26409\">Krakoa</a> into a new continent for mutants. Charles explicitly told Cain that he was not permitted to set foot on Krakoa, however, Charles admitted he believed in Cain to make the right choices.</p><p>His first choice was to track down Cyttorak's temple and get his abilities back.

Cain Marko is powered by the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, which is a conduit Cyttorak uses to channel his magical energies into his avatar. Much like <a href=\"/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Jean Grey</a> wielding only a fraction of the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/4005-2164/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2164\">Phoenix Force</a> yet retaining immense power, Cain Marko only wields a portion of of Cyttorak's power, yet also retains immense power.</p><p><b><i>Superhuman Strength:</i></b> With it he has immense strength that far exceeds the ability to lift 100 tons effortlessly. Similarly, due to the mystical nature of his powers granted by an external source of limitless magic as the Gem of Cyttorak, Juggernaut can increase his physical strength to immeasurable levels with a simple thought when he needs it. In this sense, Juggernaut has the strength-increasing option due his potential to draw on the limitless power of the mystical energy of Cyttorak, which makes him a truly unstoppable force.</p><p>In terms of strength feats, Juggernaut has knocked out Cyttorak in his own realm, where he is considered above <a href=\"/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> and the <a href=\"/celestials/4060-13343/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-13343\">Celestials</a> themselves (<a href=\"/x-men-unlimited-12-onslaught-impact-2-the-juggerna/4000-42802/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-42802\">X-Men Unlimited #12</a>, 1996).

Not to mention the Juggernaut’s superhuman strength easily rivals and possibly surpasses that of World War Hulk, who is the strongest incarnation of Hulk. In fact, Juggernaut was developed as one of the few characters (if not the unique) who being a human being can not be defeated by physical means or raw strength. Also, the limits of Juggernauts strength are unknown simply because of the fact it stems from his Cyttorak himself.</p><p>Possessed by the Trion’s own dark side by tapping into <a href=\"/cyttorak/4005-24949/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-24949\">Cyttorak</a>’s power, the Juggernaut was enabled to physically crush and tear down multiple dimensional barriers by punching them with his physical force, in order to find and kill the powerful Trion Gods (creators of the Triple Evil force). During his rampage, the Juggernaut ripped through the continuum space and time to pass out from one dimension to another, which caused the merger of several dimensions. Moreover, Juggernaut was able to split the very fabric of space-time itself whose rupture was expanding through the unearthly Trion’s universe in which he was (<a href=\"/projekt-x-x-men-88/4000-451601/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-451601\">X-Men # 88</a>, 1999 and <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men-369-unstoppable/4000-45878/\" data-ref-id=\"4000-45878\">Uncanny X-Men #369</a>, 1999).</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298344\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.53\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4298344\"><img alt=\"Digging into the bedrock\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Digging into the bedrock\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/33916/4298344-1731412-1220634_tasm_629010digg.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Digging into the bedrock</figcaption></figure><p>He can dig effortlessly into the bedrock, enduring unimaginable compressive forces under the earth's surface with pressures of hundreds of thousands cubic meters of rocks, clay and stone over all his body.

Colossus self-restricted of the Juggernaut’s powers and in his most vulnerable state left himself to be defeated by Rulk.</p><p><b><i>Superhuman Speed:</i></b> Despite juggernauts huge size, his leg muscles allow him to run at superhuman speed, being able to reach speeds of 600 miles per hour, near the speed of sound (Mach's number) and possibly more.</p><p><b><i>Invulnerability:</i></b> An invisible force field surrounding Juggernaut's body allows him to be completely immune to any purely physical attack no matter its magnitude or intensity. While Juggernaut can still be thrown, knocked back, or hit by blows, he cannot actually be damage by brute force or physical in nature. In simple terms, Juggernaut cannot be defeated by anything that requires physical application. Juggernaut proved to be invulnerable to fire, heat, cold, electricity, radiation, toxins, aging, disease, molten steel, Hulk's strongest punches, Thor's God-force blast (which caused Galactus to run away for his life on one occasion and broke the prime Celestial’s protective dome), <a href=\"/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a>'s <a href=\"/adamantium/4055-40759/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40759\">adamantium </a>claws, the maximum force of Cyclops' optic blasts (which is said had enough force to rip a small planet in half), molecular disintegration by a reality warper (<a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a> and <a href=\"/dspayre/4005-42543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42543\">D'Spayre</a> boosted with a fraction of Cyttorak’s energy which granted him a nigh-unlimited power), even he could not be destroyed or wiped out from existence by the void of <a href=\"/oblivion/4005-2496/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2496\">Oblivion</a> or Entropy.</p><p><b><i>Vast Superhuman-Durability:</i></b> Juggernaut possesses limitless superhuman durability. Even without his force-field,Juggernaut´s natural durability proved to be great enough to withstand powerhouse blows from Thor.</p><p><i><b>Healing Factor:</b></i> Juggernaut can be harmed just by mystical weapons, cosmic levelers (such as <a href=\"/captain-universe/4005-27193/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-27193\">Captain Universe</a> and <a href=\"/onslaught/4005-13352/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13352\">Onslaught</a>), and extra-dimensional beings. If he is harmed, the gem powering him will regenerate any and all wounds instantly without scarring. He has been reduced to skeleton by <a href=\"/dspayre/4005-42543/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42543\">D'Spayre</a> (boosted to a reality warper level) at one point and completely regenerated within seconds. As long as there is a single molecule of Cain's being, he is unable to die, implying that Juggernaut has one of the fastest healing factors in Marvel.</p><p><i><b>Self-Sustenance:</b></i> The mystical energies of the gem flowing through Cain's veins completely sustain him, meaning the Juggernaut can survive indefinitely without food, water, or air, rendering him immortal. In addition, Juggernaut is unable to tire or fatigue no matter the physical exertion his body puts out.</p><p><i><b>Unstoppable Momentum:</b></i> Once juggernaut gains momentum, nothing can stop him. Although things such as large mountains and the Hulk have been able to slow him down, he still runs forward. On one point, Juggernaut was reduced to a skeleton and still he did not stop.</p><p><b><i>Armor:</i></b> Juggernaut's armor is indestructible from physical forces (except for his helmet, which serves protect him from telepathy or psionics attacks), and can be summoned at will. If somehow destroyed by a reality warper or cosmic-leveler, Juggernaut can always make a new costume.</p><h3>Temporary Powers:</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741222\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-741222\"><img alt=\"Summoning his armor with a thought\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 612w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 408w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Summoning his armor with a thought\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 612w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/18519/741222-armor.jpg 408w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px\" data-width=\"408\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Summoning his armor with a thought</figcaption></figure><p>The full potential of Juggernaut's abilities are unknown even to himself, but he inadvertently (whether in his 8th day or Trion incarnation) displayed various magical abilities that he doesn't know how to replicate, such as: altering the size of matter, growing in size, tracking, levitation, absorbing energy, projecting energy, increasing his own strength, and creating portals. It’s also showed the ability to hurl back objects and people by absorbing inertia, literally \"killing the momentum\". For example, when Thor threw his hammer <a href=\"/mjolnir/4055-40971/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-40971\">Mjolnir</a> at the Juggernaut, the force-field was already affecting the hammer and was slowing it down, absorbing all the inertia from it. Another example of this ability was shown when <a href=\"/beast/4005-1462/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1462\">Beast</a> launched the 10 ton steel barrel at the Juggernaut, the force-field stopped it and then hurled back.</p><h3>Weaknesses</h3><p>Juggernaut's weaknesses are psionics and mysticism. Juggernaut has often been defeated by removing his helmet, which protects him from telepathic assault, and attacking him mentally. Mystical artifacts have also been able to cause him extreme physical damage; however, neither of these can cause Juggernaut any permanent physical or mental damage.</p><p>As a slave to Cyttorak, Juggernaut's abilities begin to wane if he is not causing enough destruction or if he is committing genuinely good deeds</p><h3>New Armor</h3><p>Ever since Juggernaut was disconnected from Cyttorak when he was banished to Limbo, he has been using a new armor. It was forged from crimson bands of Cyttorak. It increase Cain's size and strength and makes him nearly invulnerable. He also has full control of the armor, able to call and dismiss it at will, as well as lowering the telepathic shield without removing the helmet so he can still communicate with Xavier in battle.</p><h2><strong>Personal Data</strong></h2><h3><strong>Physical Characteristics</strong></h3><ul><li><b>Height</b> -- 9'5''</li><li><b>Weight </b>-- 1,900 lbs</li><li><b>Eyes</b> – Blue</li><li><b>Hair</b> -- Red</li></ul><h3><strong>Status</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Berkeley, California</li><li><strong>Citizenship:</strong> USA</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Military boarding school.</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Adventurer, Professional criminal, former teacher, mercenary, soldier.</li><li><strong>Known Relatives:</strong> Kurt Marko (father, deceased), Marjory Marko (mother, deceased), Sharon Xavier Marko (stepmother, deceased), Charles Francis Xavier (Professor X, stepbrother), Cassandra Nova (stepsister, deceased), Lilandra (ex-sister in law), David Haller (Legion, stepnephew, deceased).</li></ul><h2>Alternate Earths</h2><h3>Earth-295: Age of Apocalypse</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-87509\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4775\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:147.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-87509\"><img alt=\"Pacifist?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" data-width=\"433\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Pacifist?\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/87509-114303-juggernaut.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px\" data-width=\"433\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pacifist?</figcaption></figure><p>In the Age of Apocalypse reality Juggernaut was a pacifist monk, since Xavier wasn't alive to project his anger on to, he lived on Avalon.

He also gets stabbed multiple times by Wolverines claws with no effects. However, he is vulnerable to a lightning blast to the brain, which was executed by Wolverine's right-handed claws in the back of Juggernaut's head and Storm striking his left-handed claws. Also, his powers can be neutralized by Leech. Unlike his usual counterpart in the comics, he is a mutant here. He also appears to be unrelated to Professor X. Very little is known about Juggernaut's past.

In the film, Juggernaut is imprisoned in the mutant prison called the Ice Box, where he is described as \"the monster in the basement\", i.e. the most powerful and dangerous prisoner that the Ice Box holds. With <a href=\"/rusty-collins/4005-13376/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13376\">Firefist's</a> help, he breaks free from his confinement while the guards are transporting him and other prisoners to a more secure facility. Upon escape, he rips Deadpool in half with his bare hands, and escorts Firefist to the Essex Academy so Rusty can get his revenge on the people who tortured him. At the academy, Juggernaut and Firefist are accosted by Deadpool, Cable, Domino and the X-Men, and after a no-holds-barred battle with Colossus, Juggernaut is defeated by Piotr, <a href=\"/yukio/4005-9843/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-9843\">Yukio </a>and <a href=\"/negasonic-teenage-warhead/4005-41178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41178\">Negasonic Teenage Warhead</a>.</p><h3>Television</h3><h4><a href=\"/spiderman-and-his-amazing-friends/4075-55/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-55\">Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-715697\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.72068230277185\" data-width=\"469\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 469px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-715697\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg 469w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg 469w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/35492/715697-ju.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In the episode \"A Firestar is Born,\" Juggernaut was shown being fought by the X-Men during a flashback of <a href=\"/firestar/4005-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2101\">Firestar</a>'s past.

Colossus got mad and wanted to seek revenge on the real perpetrator. With Wolverine's investigation, he found out that the one responsible for that was the Juggernaut. The X-Men had a hard time fighting him but after ripping his helmet off, Rogue drained his power right out and Jean Grey used her psychic powers against him and defeated the unstoppable giant. As other episodes go for his appearances, he always seek revenge against the Professor but always fail. The Juggernaut once lost his powers after a young scientist found the Gem of Cyttorak in the lost Temple of Cyttorak and claimed it his own. The Juggernaut went into a coma and was in a brink of death. Wolverine and Cyclops were ordered to retrieve the lost gem to recover the Juggernaut even though they were against it. Meanwhile, Professor X dove into the Juggernaut's mind and discovered the true reason behind his half brother's hatred towards him, which he had forgotten through the ages. After the X-Men brought the Juggernaut back into his superhuman self, the big brute threw the Gem of Cyttorak into the sky (which flew all the way into outer space) and left the Xavier Mansion, not harming the X-Men along the way. Professor X's reaction was, <i>\"I believe it's his way of saying 'thank you'.\"</i></p><h4><a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/xmen-evolution/4075-25/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-25\">X-Men: Evolution</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224960\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224960\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/10376/224960-84462-juggernaut.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Mystique released the Juggernaut from a specialized prison, tasking him with attacking Xavier's Mansion and retrieving Cerebro.

He spent his childhood in a gang called The Rivals along with his friend <a href=\"/willis-stryker/4005-44388/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44388\">Willis Stryker</a>. Lucas engaged in many gang fights with The Diablos, a rival gang. He also committed petty crimes and worked for a crime lord named Sonny Caputo.</p><p>Eventually, Lucas was put through the juvenile justice system and realized the pain he was causing his family. He changed his ways and in his adulthood, he joined The <a href=\"/nypd/4060-57310/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57310\">NYPD</a> ( New York City Police Department) as a police officer. Willis Stryker rose through the ranks of crime. Stryker's actions brought the anger of <a href=\"/maggia/4060-26082/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-26082\">The Maggia,</a> a New York crime syndicate.</p><p>The Maggia ordered a hit on Stryker and he was badly injured, only to be saved by Carl Lucas. Stryker's girlfriend (Reva Conners) grew fearful of his line of work and began to distance herself from him. She breaks up with him and finds comfort in Lucas. Stryker then believes that Lucas is the one responsible for the break up between him and Reva. In revenge, he planted drugs in Lucas' Harlem apartment and tipped off the cops. Lucas is then wrongly convicted and imprisoned.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Luke Cage was created by <a href=\"/archie-goodwin/4040-42923/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42923\">Archie Goodwin, Roy Thomas, George Tuska </a>and <a href=\"/john-romita/4040-7499/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-7499\">John Romita</a>.and first appeared in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hero-for-hire-1-out-of-hell-a-hero/4000-12266/\">Hero for Hire issue 1 </a>(1972).</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Luke Cage was one of the first African <em>American</em> super heroes in mainstream comics among the likes of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/falcon/4005-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1451\">Falcon </a>and the <em>African</em> hero, the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>. However, his creation was criticized by some for promoting racial stereotypes, as he was initially involved in gang crime. The character's public perception has began to change as times progress and has even, grown in popularity.

He engages in jail fights and makes numerous failed escape attempts. Lucas, is then transferred to a prison on the coast of Georgia. He faces racism from one of the guards named Quirt. Captain Rackham blames Lucas for being demoted when a new warden dislikes how the prison is run. Lucas then volunteers for an experiment which will shorten his sentence. <a href=\"/dr-noah-burstein/4005-3157/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3157\">Dr. Noah Burstein</a> puts him in an electrical field with a chemical compound, leaving him unattended for a moment. Rackham tampers with the controls, causing an overload. Pushed way past its original intent, the resulting incident empowers Lucas with super strength and gives him nearly impervious skin. Lucas uses his power to escape from the prison and later makes his way back to New York City.</p><p>Lucas then adopted a costume and the name \"Luke Cage\" and became a Hero For Hire, working for anyone who can meet his price. He set up an office in Times Square in the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/gem-theater/4020-60604/\">Gem Theater</a>, and is eventually proven innocent and exonerated from his crimes.

Steve Rogers and Tony Stark end up selling the mansion (which was recently renovated) to Luke Cage for a dollar, allowing him freedom to recruit his own Avengers team and operate without directly taking orders from Rogers, though Rogers insists on having <a href=\"/victoria-hand/4005-59261/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-59261\">Victoria Hand</a> join them as a liaison. While inviting his team over for a discussion, Cage and his team are forced to assist <a href=\"/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a> ,Daimon Hellstorm, and <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/4005-10280/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10280\">Brother Voodoo</a> in thwarting an attempt by Agamotto - the original owner of the <a href=\"/eye-of-agamotto/4055-55701/\" data-ref-id=\"4055-55701\">Eye of Agamotto</a> - to destroy existence, culminating in the apparent death of Brother Voodoo. Although initially against the idea of being paid for being on the team as it reminds him of the reasons they opposed the Act in the first place, Cage is convinced to accept the offer.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>When it comes to the attention of the other heroes that Daredevil has set up his \"Shadowland\" within Hell's Kitchen, Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor accept it because they believe his rule will stabilize the empty power vacuum that resides after the events of Siege. However, they also state that once the heroes are truly back on their feet, his reign would have to end and because of certain aspects that have changed about his personality and methods, they send Luke and Iron Fist to tell him how things are going to work out.</p><p>When the pair arrives at Daredevil's stronghold they find him and his hand minions engaged in a heated battle with his arch-nemesis Bullseye. Luke and Iron Fist offer to back up Daredevil, but he turns them away because they will not swear their full allegiance to The Hand. Fearing that their friend's new direction will end terribly, they try to shut down the fight, but instead are forced to look on in terror as Daredevil takes matters into his own hands and brutally murders Bullseye.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men: Retirement</h3><p>During the events of <a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/4045-56674/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56674\">Avengers Vs.

While the Avengers were off-planet, the mad titan <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/thanos/4005-7607/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7607\">Thanos </a>decided to invade Earth. Prior to Thanos' invasion, Luke decided to get back into the Heroes for Hire business. He offered internships to <a href=\"/avengers-academy/4060-57354/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57354\">Avengers Academy</a> graduates, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ava-ayala/4005-80709/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-80709\">Ava Ayala</a> and <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/power-man-alvarez/4005-71023/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-71023\">Victor Alvarez</a>.</p><p>After preventing <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/parnival-plunder/4005-23412/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-23412\">Parnival Plunder</a> from stealing robot parts, Luke and his interns have a run-in with the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/4005-1485/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1485\">\"Superior\" Spider-Man</a>. This \"superior\" Spider-Man is really Doctor Octopus with his mind implanted into Peter Parker's body (readers commonly refer to him as \"SpOck\"). During the encounter, SpOck labeled Luke and his interns \"hired thugs\", which led to an argument with Victor Alvarez. The argument was interrupted by Ava, who agreed with SpOck and decided to resign from the internship, stating that as heroes, they all should be doing more.</p><p>Luke respected her decision and allowed her to leave. He then attempted to calm Victor down, who was still fuming from SpOck's comments, by treating him to coffee. Luke agreed with Victor that SpOck's comments were inappropriate. He also agreed with Ava's comments about \"doing more.\" He told Victor about his retirement from the Avengers (to take care of his daughter) and how since doing so, he hasn't done much to make the world a better place for her to grow up in. Victor misinterpreted this as Luke saying he no longer wants to be in the Hero for Hire business and stormed out of the restaurant.</p><p>Later, the streets of Manhattan are flooded with demons led by Thanos' general <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/proxima-midnight/4005-90522/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90522\">Proxima Midnight</a>. Luke immediately began to combat the demons alongside several other heroes who were in Manhattan at the time. SpOck, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/monica-rambeau/4005-11337/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11337\">Monica Rambeau</a> and \"Spider Hero\" (<a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blade/4005-7570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7570\">Blade</a>), all joined Luke to fend off the demons. Luke also combats Proxima for a while and at one point, gained the upper hand, but was ultimately put down by the powerful general. During the battle, his resilience and determination to win angered Proxima, and when she was unable to kill him (due to his unbreakable skin) Thanos ordered her to return to base. Another one of Thanos' generals, <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/ebony-maw/4005-90606/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-90606\">Ebony Maw</a>, joined the fight and used his special abilities to manipulate an infected <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Dr. Strange</a> into summoning <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/shuma-gorath/4005-14000/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-14000\">Shuma-Gorath</a>! However, the multidimensional demon was not at its full strength. When the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/blue-marvel/4005-57033/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-57033\">Blue Marvel</a>, Victor, and Ava later arrived in Manhattan to help clear up the remaining demons, they joined Monica Rambeau and combined their abilities to send Gorath back to it's own dimension. During the battle, Victor dubbed them the \"Mighty Avengers\". The team remained together until the events of Secret Wars, when an incursion seemingly destroyed the Marvel Universe, but was actually reshaped and luckily returned to normal soon.</p><h3>The Boys are Back</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4923624\" data-ratio=\"1.4822222222222\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.2%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4923624\"><img alt=\"Heroes for Hire, again\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" data-width=\"431\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 647w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 431w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Heroes for Hire, again\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 900w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 647w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/4923624-pmif2016001-greene-d3dfc.jpg 431w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px\" data-width=\"431\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Heroes for Hire, again</figcaption></figure><p>Luke and his buddy Danny get in over their head when they do a favor for their mutual friend, <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/jennie-royce/4005-34291/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-34291\">Jennie Royce</a>, upon her release from prison.

The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight. Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment.

However this time it was revealed that the Red Skull had actually set up the meeting between Sam and Captain America on Exile Island. The Red Skull had actually changed Sam's persona and altered his memories. Sam Wilson, social worker of Harlem was actually Snap Wilson, notorious criminal charged with multiple cases of importation and sales of narcotics. During the trial the Stilt Man had attempted to kill the Falcon, but was thwarted by Sam and Redwing. Ultimately the judge placed Sam on parole with none other than Nick Fury as Sam's parole officer.</p><p>Some time later, Falcon rejoined the Avengers at Captain America's urging.

Later, Captain America saved Falcon from being killed by taking a bullet meant for his friend.

A tip from Misty Knight put him and Torres on a possible vibranium smuggling operation, where they find migrants being attacked by mysterious henchmen. Sam and Torres split up to investigate further, with Sam tracking the vibranium source. This lead him to Wakanda. The Wakandan government was not willing to partner with Captain America, so Sam took upon himself to investigate without their approval.</p><p>With help from a youth movement, Wakanda Forever, he went undercover as an American expat looking for a new home. He was ambushed by Crossbones, who revealed that he was working for White Wolf. Together, they had planned a bioterrorist attack using vibranium as the trigger. Sam attempted to stop him but was interrupted by Black Panther and the new Prime Minister of Wakanda. They took Crossbones into custody, but for Sam's crimes, all American asylum seekers were turned away.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Meeting back up with Torres, Sam continues looking into White Wolf as their two investigations become one. In a pro-apartheid attack in Mohannda, Torres is injured, forcing Sam to team up with Nomad, who had never died. They head back to Mohannda to continue protecting the people from pro-apartheid forces, when they are confronted by mutated mercenaries that Nomad recognizes as being from Dimension Z. White Wolf was using Dimension Z portals to achieve a technologically advanced apartheid nation. After a brief spat with a mutated and rageful Torres, Sam aims his own rage at White Wolf for what is happening to his friend. Sam beats him down and then takes him into custody.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">Cold War</h3><p>Sam investigates the prison break of White Wolf, facilitated by Buck and the Outer Circle. As a result, Sam and Misty team up with Cap and Sharon Carter, who were already investigating the kidnapping of Ian Zola by Peggy Carter, also working for Bucky. They track them to an Alaskan training facility where they were using Dimension Z portal tech to bring Dimension Z monsters to join their ranks. Determining Ian is being held by the White Wolf on the other side of the portal, the heroes head in together.</p><p>On the other side, they were nearly taken out by an explosion. Misty and Sharon are badly hurt, however, Cap pushes forward. Sam does his best to talk him down from being so headstrong, but being back in Dimension Z has caused Cap considerable post-traumatic stress. The two Caps are forced to duke it out with Sam eventually knocking some sense into Cap, who regrouped himself to rejoin his allies. Cap deferred to Sam who suggested they trade sparring partners. Sam and Sharon would go after Bucky, and Cap and Misty would go after the Wolf. After a considerable beat down on Bucky, Sam dragged him conscious to be confronted by Cap. </p><p>Bucky revealed this was always his plan, for them to think he went to the dark side. He was actually using Wolf for access to Dimension Z so they could have the resources for an attack on the Outer Circle. Ian wasn't a real prisoner of Bucky's. Bucky intended him to take the throne from Wolf. Sam believed in the plan and helped convince Cap and Sharon to stay behind and plan the attack while he and Misty returned to Earth to keep the peace until they returned. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><strong>Telepathic Link:</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-133469\" data-ratio=\"1.06\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-133469\"><img alt=\"Falcon using his bird telepathy \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Falcon using his bird telepathy \" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5302/133469-137935-falcon.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" data-width=\"603\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Falcon using his bird telepathy </figcaption></figure><p>Since his early childhood Falcon had a natural affinity for birds and could understand them and see through the eyes of them.

By the finale of the series, Sam embraces the role and decides to become the new Captain America after all, donning a new costume and set of wings made in Wakanda.</p><h3>Captain America: New World Order (2024)</h3><p>Now officially active as the new Captain America, Sam Wilson will be headlining a Captain America solo movie, tentatively dated May 3, 2024.</p><h3><ins>Animation</ins></h3><h4>Avengers: United They Stand</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623261\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"384\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 384px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1623261\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg 384w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg 384w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/64684/1623261-falcon.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Falcon made his animated debut in the short-lived television series <i><a href=\"/the-avengers-united-they-stand/4075-122/\" data-ref-id=\"4075-122\">Avengers: United they Stand</a>,</i> first appearing in the second episode.

The purpose of this was to create a new team of Horsemen, known as the Horsemen of Death, with the team consisting of Banshee, Grim Reaper, Daken and Sentry.</p><p>Since the defeat of the twins, Sentry has been acting on his own as a cosmic protector of Earth. He is no longer under the influence of the Death Seed. Instead, he has been assisting people like Doctor Strange and finding his way back into the superhero community.</p><h2>Origin</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-697085\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/697085-sentry_12.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5588235294118\" data-width=\"170\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 170px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/19940/697085-sentry_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-697085\"><img alt=\"Original Costume\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/19940/697085-sentry_12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/19940/697085-sentry_12.jpg 170w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-width=\"170\"></a><figcaption>Original Costume</figcaption></figure><p>In the year, 2000 Bob Reynolds, a seemingly normal man, suddenly recalls that he is the superhero known as the Sentry, the man with the power of one million exploding suns. Along with this recollection, he also realizes his arch-nemesis, the Void, is returning to the world. Reynolds immediately begins seeking out the rest of the world's most prominent superheroes to warn them of the coming threat.</p><p>Various heroes' memories of Sentry are restored as Reynolds talks to them individually. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Peter Parker</a> had taken a photo of Sentry that had earned him a Pulitzer prize. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/archangel/4005-2112/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2112\">Angel</a> recalls flying alongside Sentry, to help overcome his fear of falling. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hulk/4005-2267/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2267\">Hulk</a> had never forgotten Sentry, whom he only ever referred to as \"Golden Man\". Sentry had helped Hulk keep control of his rage; later, this was revealed to be a product of a calming aura the Sentry can give off, which helped the Hulk work to be a force solely for good and to gain public approval. The people eventually remember their own memories about the Sentry and his former sidekick, Scout. Most importantly, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/4005-2151/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2151\">Mr. Fantastic</a> remembers that he and Robert Reynolds had been best friends and that Sentry had often teamed up with the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/4060-3804/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3804\">Fantastic Four</a> to fight the world's greatest threats. Over time the general public slowly remember the Sentry and the good he had done for the world.</p><p>During the course of an investigation into why the world had forgotten Sentry, Richards and Reynolds make a discovery: the Void and the Sentry are two parts of the same torn psyche. The reason the world forgot the Sentry was that Reynolds had used his power to erase the Sentry from the memory of everyone in the world, including his own, thus destroying the Void once and for all. With the heroes of the world united and waiting for the Void to come, Reynolds comes to the realization that he must make the sacrifice again. With the help of C.L.O.C., Sentry's computer assistant, Mr. Fantastic, and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/4005-1456/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1456\">Doctor Strange</a>, he once again erases the memory of Sentry from the world.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Marvel promoted a limited series of <i>The Sentry</i> as the reappearance of a forgotten <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/4040-40467/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40467\">Stan Lee</a>-created hero of the Marvel Silver Age. This story was, of course, fabricated, and further pushed by the comic magazine <em>Wizard: Guide To Comics</em>.

Sentry easily overpowers Carnage, flies him to the edges of the atmosphere, and tears him in two.</p><p>Taking a great interest in the now free Sentry, the Avengers begin investigating his dark persona.

This virus damaged the Sentry's ability to remember any facts of his life. In a cry for help and an amazing show of power, Sentry transferred his memories into comic book writer Paul Jenkins, who transferred those memories into a popular comic book series. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/1457/\" data-ref-id=\"1457\">Emma Frost</a> releases Sentry from the bonds of his virus, and he recalls much about his life, including that he never actually killed his wife and that his Watchtower stood atop Stark Tower, where he had subconsciously hidden it from public view.</p><p>With his memory recovered, he joins with the Avengers and begins fighting alongside them.</p><h3>Destruction of The Void</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1157559\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.55703125\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:155.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1157559\"><img alt=\"The Void , Angel of Death\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-width=\"411\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 616w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 411w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Void , Angel of Death\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 616w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/6/62014/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035.jpg 411w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px\" data-width=\"411\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Void , Angel of Death</figcaption></figure><p>Returned to the world, the Sentry captures the hearts of the public. Newspapers begin referring to him as \"the Golden Guardian of Good,\" as he was saving hundreds of lives on a daily basis. Reynolds' psychological problems, however, had worsened. Unable to reconcile that Robert Reynolds, the Sentry, and the Void were the same being, the Sentry contained the Void in a vault in the Watchtower. At C.L.O.C.'s urging, Reynolds' psychiatrist Dr. Cornelius Worth enters the vault and finds only a chair and a mirror. When Cornelius confronts Reynolds with this, Reynolds becomes confused and runs to the fairgrounds where he first gained his powers.</p><p>Cornelius follows Reynolds to the fairgrounds where the Sentry and the Void had been fighting. The Void claimed that Reynolds transformed into the Void rather than the Sentry, and that the Sentry was merely a guilt-borne byproduct of that transformation. With only half of Robert Reynolds' memories (the Void possessing the other half), the Sentry isn't not sure the Void was wrong. The Sentry chases the Void away and then explains to Cornelius why Reynolds had hired him in the first place. Reynolds subconsciously wanted someone to reveal the Void's existence to the world so he would no longer have to hide that aspect of himself. The Sentry told Cornelius that he knew all along that the Void was never in the Watchtower's vault. He knew that if Reynolds believed the Void to be in the Watchtower, the Void would really be there. This kept the world safe from the Void for as long as the Sentry could keep up the charade.</p><p>The Sentry then reveals the true way he gained his powers. He ingested a super soldier serum while his was a teenager, breaking into a lab to find new ways to experience a high. The Sentry then visited Dr. Strange to determine if he was real or not. Strange tricked the Sentry into traveling to his old Professor's research facility, and on an attempt to prevent any further destruction, the two men confined the Sentry in an illusionary realm in which he was a mental patient and superheroes didn't exist. The Sentry breaks free of the illusion and, after confronting the Professor, travels to Antarctica to confront the Void in order to discover what memories of Reynolds the Void has in his mind.</p><p>In the Antarctic battle, the Void reveals that the serum Sentry ingested was actually super-saturated, an exponentially more potent super-soldier serum than what created <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/1442/\" data-ref-id=\"1442\">Captain America</a>. This was considered dangerous by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/shield/4060-3775/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-3775\">SHIELD</a> because Sentry's blood could be used to create enough serum to power the entire world population; several attempts had been made against both the Void and Sentry to kill him. Enraged by this news, the Sentry flies into space and hurls the Void into the sun, claiming that he was no longer needed to balance out the Sentry's acts of good. The Void swears to return.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/civil-war/4045-40615/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40615\">Superhuman Civil War</a>, the Sentry sides with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/4005-1455/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1455\">Iron Man</a>'s Pro-Registration program. He accompanies a S.H.I.E.L.D. squad to battle <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/4005-1440/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1440\">Wolverine</a> and tells him that he didn't want to get involved but saw no choice; the Sentry claims that he has to stop the ugly business, even if that means becoming a part of it for a while. He then knocks Wolverine unconscious and hands him over to S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, the Sentry flies to the moon in an attempt to escape from a battle among the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a>, believing that every path he can choose will ultimately lead to the death of people he knows. There he is confronted by the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/4060-11427/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-11427\">Inhumans</a>; believing him a threat, the Inhumans order him to follow them into <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/4005-4329/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4329\">Black Bolt</a>'s presence in the so-called \"Blue Area\" of the Moon. After a discussion of the Civil War events with the still unaware Inhumans, he rekindles his friendship with them and almost resumes his past relationship with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/crystal/4005-2115/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2115\">Crystal</a>. He is then confronted by Iron Man himself who finally convinces a still reluctant Sentry to join him. Stark tells the Sentry that his support will help <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/4005-1442/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1442\">Captain America</a>, leader of the anti-Registration faction, to understand that the world is changing. Three days after the climactic battle of the Civil War, the Sentry publicly announces his support of the Registration Act. He is identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes of the Initiative.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214291\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5015015015015\" data-width=\"333\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 333px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214291\"><img alt=\"Unstable Sentry vs World War Hulk\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg 333w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Unstable Sentry vs World War Hulk\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg 333w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" data-width=\"426\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Unstable Sentry vs World War Hulk</figcaption></figure><p>Sentry's Watchtower on the top of Stark Tower is destroyed when Hulk and Iron Man first fought in New York.

Robert agreed, and became one of the first members of the Dark Avengers.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214322\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png\" data-ratio=\"1.3883333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214322\"><img alt=\"Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png 460w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/8/83882/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay</figcaption></figure><p>The first mission of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/4060-55990/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55990\">Dark Avengers</a> is to help Doctor Doom and the rest of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/latveria/4020-41031/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-41031\">Latveria</a> from an attack by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/morgan-le-fay/4005-13925/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-13925\">Morgan Le Fay</a>. As the Dark Avengers and Sentry arrive in Latveria, they see Doom unconcious on the floor. When Morgan approaches, Osborn tells Sentry to unleash his powers to defeat her. Sentry easily rips off Morgan's head. Sentry then wonders if what he did was right or wrong, and Osborn assures him that what he did was right. The Dark Avengers seem successful in their first mission, as they defeat Morgan and save Latveria. Sentry starts to scream and there is an explosion. After it clears, Morgan Le Fay is seen alive and the Sentry is gone. After Morgan's eventual defeat, the Dark Avengers return to Avengers Tower. There is a brilliant flash of light as they arrive and the Sentry is seen alive and well, hovering in front of his tower. Norman manages to calm down the confused Sentry.</p><p>The next time Osborn calls upon Reynolds, it is in response to an Atlantean terrorist cell's attack on U.S. soil. Reynolds is surprised when Osborn doesn't ask for the Sentry, but instead suggests that the Void is needed to kill all but one of the terrorists as an act of vengeance. Sentry counters that Osborn himself once said that the Void is not real, but Osborn only repeats his request for what needs to be done. As a result, the Sentry performs the bloody task, leaving doubts as to whether the Sentry was still in control, or if the Void had once again taken over.</p><p>Sentry and the Dark Avengers go to San Francisco to quell the riots that are happening between humans and mutants. When the Dark Avengers and the Dark X-Men fight against the X-Men, Emma Frost enters Reynolds' mind and releases him from the Void's control, resulting in Sentry flying away from the battle. When Emma's hold over the Void's relinquished, it chases after Sentry but leaves behind a small part of itself within Emma, trapped inside of her diamond form.</p><p>When Sentry makes his way to the Avengers Tower, his wife shoots him in the head with a ray gun. He is later seen arriving at the end of a battle between the Dark Avengers and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/man-thing/4005-4988/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4988\">Man-Thing</a> in Louisiana. Sentry is then sent out to investigate an energy disturbance in a little town called Dinosaur, Colorado. Once there, he notices a man in a cowboy hat and tries to get his attention. Suddenly, his hand begins to glow black, almost as if on fire. Energy erupts from his eyes until he explodes. Osborn immediately assembles his Dark Avengers to find Reynolds.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214302\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214302\"><img alt=\"Sentry overpowering Molecule Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sentry overpowering Molecule Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sentry overpowering Molecule Man</figcaption></figure><p>Sentry is again shown alive, in what appears to be a high school gym. On the ground, energy continues to emanate from him. He appears to be dissolving, leaving him in great pain. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/molecule-man/4005-11880/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11880\">Molecule Man</a> enters and explains how he has never experienced molecules like Sentry's, before ripping Reynolds to pieces. The Sentry appears to disintegrate, but later reforms once again and confronts Molecule Man. He is able to stop Reece, forcing the villain to restore everything to the way it was, before banishing him. Afterwards, he explains he has realized the source of his power was the ability control molecules. Again, Osborn and the Avengers find themselves both in awe and deeply afraid of his power. After witnessing his power, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/moonstone/4005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3279\">Ms. Marvel</a> tells Osborn that <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/4005-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1466\">Scarlet Witch's</a> mental breakdown was nothing compared to what Sentry may do.</p><p>Sentry once again seems to have escaped death when he appears behind <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/noh-varr/4005-11565/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11565\">Noh Varr</a> claiming that Osborn needs to speak with him. A battle ensues in which Noh Varr begins to blast and throw cars at Sentry, to little effect. Sentry claims he doesn't want to fight, but that Osborn wants Noh Varr back \"dead or alive\". Noh Varr refuses to go to Osborn, claiming that the whole Dark Avengers team consists of criminals or the insane, to which Sentry responds that he himself is neither. Sentry is then blasted out of the sky by a girl using one of Noh Varr's weapons. He dodges the continuous assault of energy blasts and flies straight up through the clouds until a giant green explosion is seen from the ground. Sentry once again lands in the city and is soon joined by the rest of the Dark Avengers. When asked to find Noh Varr again, Sentry states that he used to have an aura which is no longer present, so he cannot.</p><p>Eventually, it is revealed that Osborn was indeed able to awaken the Void inside of Sentry, which slowly attempted to take control of his body. Claiming to be the God, the Void was able to convince Reynolds to give up control of his Sentry form. Void then tries to cause massive chaos, but is reminded by Osborn that such actions could cause his own downfall, causing him to once again calm down.</p><p>It later becomes clear that the Void was Osborn's secret weapon, which he used to evict Doom from the Cabal after his refusal to join them. Later, Sentry found out that his wife had committed suicide, although in reality Osborn had ordered Bullseye to kill her before Lester threw her out of the jet and into the ocean near Los Angeles.</p><h3>Siege of Asgard</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214290\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.78175895765472\" data-width=\"614\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 614px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2214290\"><img alt=\"Death of Ares\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Death of Ares\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg 614w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/83882/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Death of Ares</figcaption></figure><p>Osborn, deciding to cement his power base over America, chooses to attack Asgard under the guidance of Loki. As Osborn's secret weapon, Sentry is the first to attack the city and does battle with numerous Asgardians, including Thor. Ares becomes aware of Osborn's darker motives for attacking Asgard and turns on him. Osborn responds by sending the Sentry to defeat the War god; in the resulting fight, Sentry tears Ares in half.</p><p>After the death of Ares, Captain America and the Avengers arrive and Osborn's armor is shut down by Iron Man. In a final effort to snatch victory, Osborn orders the Sentry to tear down Asgard around them. When Osborn is finally taken down by Captain America and the Avengers, he reveals that he was the only person keeping Sentry in check. It now seems that the Sentry has merged with the Void.</p><p>The Avengers try to mount an offensive against the Sentry, but they are overwhelmed by his power. Loki, feeling responsible for all the destruction he had inadvertently caused, uses the Norn Stones to reenergize the Avengers. Recharged for battle, the Avengers take the battle directly to the Sentry. Seemingly off balance, the Sentry realizes that Loki is helping the Avengers and instantly kills Loki by ripping him in half. Having lost their edge, Iron Man commandeers a SHIELD Helicarrier present, turning it into a large bullet, and rams it into the Sentry. The resulting massive explosion succesfully incapacitates Sentry.</p><p>Battered and beaten, the Sentry reverts back to Robert Reynolds and asks to be killed after realizing the damage he had caused. Thor is reluctant at first, and wants Reynolds to pay for his crimes. When the Void begins to regain control, however, Thor summons a bolt of lightning with Mjolnir and delivers one final blow, killing both Robert Reynolds and the Void. To honour his death, Thor takes the remains of the Sentry and destroys them by throwing them into the sun.</p><h3>Uncanny Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3216717\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3216717\"><img alt=\"There is no Void within me\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"There is no Void within me\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11111/111113435/3216717-screen%20shot%202013-08-03%20at%2013.16.51.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There is no Void within me</figcaption></figure><p>The Sentry later returns after being repurposed by the Apocalypse Twins to become a Horseman of Death. When Wolverine's crew of Uncanny Avengers eventually discover the Twin's hideout, The Sentry makes a beeline for Thor. The only person able to tell the assault was coming is Wolverine, whose heightened hearing picked up the sonic-boom the Sentry created when he began flying towards them. Moving too quickly for Wolverine to warn the team, Sentry succesfully tackles Thor and removes him from the field of battle, flying him through across the reaches of space in a few instants. After temporarily incapacitating him, Sentry explains that he isn't angry at Thor for what he did, instead saying that he understands Thor's rage at the Void murdering Loki during the Siege on Asgard. The Sentry goes on to make references to a \"mutant rapture\" and tells Thor he won't kill him because he needs him alive, stating that it's \"better for humanity\". Confused, Thor asks him if The Void has taken control of him, to which the Sentry replies that the Void is no longer present in his psyche, and has been replaced by Death itself.</p><p>Sentry defeats Thor with relative ease and returns to guard the Tachyon Dam where he encounters the Wasp. She desperately tries battling the Sentry only to be to saved by the return of Thor. Both are soon overwhelmed by the new Sentry before Janet using her abilities to cause an earthworm to devour Robert. After the defeat of the Twins, Sentry is released from their control. When the Avengers Unity Squads' consciousness' return to them from the Planet X timeline to stop Exitar the Executioner from destroying the earth, Thor and Wasp convince Sentry to help them. He stops one of the Celestial's feet single-handedly, and leaves the planet with the body of the dead Celestial, offering to dump it at the edges of the universe.. before he leaves he tells Janet how he was happy to be an Avenger again and warns her to prepare for the wrath of the Celestials. He has not been sighted since.</p><h3>Marvel Legacy</h3><p>The Sentry has recently returned, being cured of the Apocalypse seed supposedly by Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is said to have assisted Robert Reynolds's in getting rid of not only his schizophrenia, but also the Void itself. When Doctor Strange loses the title of Sorcerer Supreme to Asgardian God Loki, Robert is asked to assist Doctor Strange in invading Asgard and finding Loki.</p><p>Afterwards, it is found out that the Void has been released. The Sentry, Doctor Strange and Loki successfully lock the Void back into the Sanctum Sanctorum. However, in the end the Sentry warns Doctor Strange to not contact him again for not being truthful about the Void's presence in the beginning.</p><h3>Sentry World</h3><p>The Sentry proceeded to wander among the stars, trying to find a way to die. He was found by Doctor Strange, to whom Rob begged to be killed, but the Sorcerer Supreme didn't know how he could manage to do that.<sup><a href=\"https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Reynolds_(Earth-616)#cite_note-Doctor_Strange_Vol_1_385-56\" rel=\"nofollow \">[56]</a></sup> Instead, Strange helped Robert find peace by locking him within his own mindscape, curing him of Apocalypse's influence in the process. Following the loss of the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme to Loki, Strange sought Rob's help and brought him back from the confinements of his own mind in order to help him invade Asgardia to take a portion of the World Tree's mystical power to be used against Loki. At the Kamar-Taj, the Sentry assisted Strange and became subject to a ritual that passed onto him the physical toll that Strange would've taken for every spell cast during his fight against Loki, which had little effect on him due to his superhuman physiology. Robert returned to New York to help the former and current Sorcerers Supreme against the Void, who had been released by Strange to take Loki down. After locking the Void back at the Sanctum Sanctorum, the Sentry confronted Strange for releasing the Void and, disappointed by his actions, Bob warned Stephen to never contact him again.</p><p>Using a device called the Confluctor, Bob gained the ability to access the pocket universe Doctor Strange had set up inside his mind. In this \"Sentry World,\" Bob could freely act as the Sentry, without risking the Void manifesting in the real world. By day, he trudged through a mundane life as Bob Reynolds, and each night he used the Confluctor to become the Sentry and fight crime with the Sentry Family: Scout, Sentress and Watchdog. In order to keep the Void at bay, Bob needed to return to Sentry World once every 24 hours. After returning from the Sentry World, Bob discovered that the Confluctor had been stolen, and that someone had entered the Sentry World and killed Scout. Discovering that the real Billy Turner was behind this, wanting to take his place as the Sentry with help from Cranio - an old enemy of the Sentry's - Reynolds snapped, merged with the Void to become a dark version of the Sentry, killed Billy, and then flew off into space after a brief confrontation with the Avengers.Annihilation</p><p>Struggling to understand his new state of self, the Sentry returned to Earth to ponder about it. While meditating, he unintentionally started to warp reality around himself, engulfing the entire town of Pawhuska in a field of bad energy that attacked whoever entered it both physically (through monsters) and mentally (through vivid illusions). Said energy was eventually detected by Black Panther and the Agents of Wakanda, who went on to investigate it. With the help of his fellow agents, Fat Cobra was able to purge the evil energy from the Sentry's body and dispose of it. Ashamed by his own actions, the Sentry fled.</p><p>Soon after, the Sentry went after Mister Fantastic and begged him to set him free of the Void forever. After extensive tests, Richards discovered there was no way to separate the Sentry from the Void under the laws of their universe, so he sent him to the Negative Zone in the hopes that he would succeed there. Upon soaking up the negative cosmic rays, the Sentry separated from the Void but was left in the powerless form of Bob Reynolds, unable to transform into his superhero alter ego. The Void fled, stranding Bob in the Negative Zone until the Silver Surfer found him weeks later and merged with him in order to defeat the Void, who became the apparent leader of the Cancerverse forces in the meantime and was leading an invasion through the Negative Zone.</p><p>After Reed Richards opened a portal to assemble the galaxy's greatest heroes against the Cancerverse, a group of heroes held the Void still so the Silver Surfer could merge Bob Reynolds to him again. They hoped that Bob would call off the invasion once in control, but that wasn't possible as the Void wasn't truly the Cancerverse's leader and it was now hellbent on getting Nova back to the fold. With no other option, Nova attracted the Cancerverse's infection back to the tear it was coming from and swallowed it whole. The merged Sentry then killed Nova, thus ending the scourge and closing the rift. While all the other heroes returned to the Positive Zone, the Sentry remained behind to watch over the universe he almost killed.</p><h3>King In Black</h3><p>In light of the impending invasion of Earth by Knull - the primordial god of darkness who had created the symbiotes - the Sentry, restored to his original form, was recalled to Earth by the Avengers, who told Knull that they would watch his demise. Killing one of the symbiote-controlled Celestials, the Sentry grabbed Knull and attempted to fly him into orbit and rip him in half as he once had Carnage. Instead, Knull reversed their positions and ripped the Sentry apart before assimilating the Void into himself.</p><p>After his death, Sentry became a ghost inhabiting Earth's orbit. He had a conversation with the Valkyrie Jane Foster about everything he had lived through until his death at the hands of Knull. As they made their way to Valhalla, in Realm Between they encountered a headless Celestial who was corrupted after his death at the hands of the King in Black using All-Black, the Celestial intended to assimilate Sentry. Despite attempts to stop him, the Celestial succeeded.</p><p>Brunhilde, Ivanir and Dani Moonstar performed a ritual that severed the headless celestial's connection to Knull's All-Black, and Jane convinced the Celestial to release the souls it had imprisoned by setting them free. Sentry finally feeling complete was whole and ready to move on to the afterlife.</p><h3>Revenant</h3><p>The Sentry was a hero resurrected as a revenant for The Blasphemy Cartel. In this form, Sentry was powered by a million ghosts. The cartel saved him as their secret weapon. After their other revenants were taken out by Doctor Strange and Clea, they released Sentry after them. He proved to strong for them until Clea cast a spell combing the two of them into one being. They exorcised the ghosts from Sentry causing a massive explosion destroying the cartel's headquarters and seemingly killing all cartel members. </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-784766\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.6178489702517\" data-width=\"437\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 437px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:161.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-784766\"><img alt=\"Power of a Million Exploding Suns\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px\" data-width=\"395\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg 437w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg 395w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Power of a Million Exploding Suns\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg 437w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/28028/784766-sentry_returns001.jpg 395w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px\" data-width=\"395\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Power of a Million Exploding Suns</figcaption></figure><p>Since his inception, the Sentry has proven himself to be one of the most powerful superheroes in the Marvel Universe. He has personally estimated the high level of his overall power by often stating that he has the \"power of a million exploding suns.\" Spider-Man stated that Sentry fought <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/galactus/4005-2149/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2149\">Galactus</a> to a standstill, although this is a hotly debated subject due to Spider-Man's penchant for satire and hyperbole. It was later revealed that this feat was not done alone as Sentry stalemated the world eater with the help of X-Man, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/x-man/4005-15051/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-15051\">Nate Grey</a>, at one of his highest points in power.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Strength:</strong> His strength has enabled him to overpower beings such as Ares, the Olympian God of War with ease; destroy Asgard by flying through the foundation; easily defeat Terrax, a creation and former Herald of Galactus, and break his axe, and engage and fight to a draw an enraged Hulk whose power levels had increased beyond anything seen before. He has also been able to destroy the shields of Doctor Doom, beat down the female version of Ultron, and physically tear apart Carnage in a single move.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Speed:</strong> Sentry possesses exceedingly high-level super-speed. This allows him to perform such feats as catching a bullet in his hand and flying from the Earth to the Sun and back in a matter of minutes. In <em>Uncanny Avengers</em> , Sentry's speed was such that his strikes against Thor were bending \"space and time\" with their velocity, according to the narration. In the same issue, we see him cover many dozens of light years in a few seconds, a formidable feat of speed.</p><p><strong>Superhuman Senses:</strong> It has been observed that Sentry has extremely heightened senses. His hearing allows him to hear a butterfly sneeze in Africa, while he himself is in a crowded bar in New York. Later, in the Philippines, Sentry is able to hear Norman Osborn calling to him from New York. He was also able to see microscopic red particles surrounding Red Ronin, which evaded even Iron Man's sensors.</p><p><strong>Invulnerability/Regeneration:</strong> Sentry is one of the few superhumans to be considered <i>invincible</i>. Other than his fragile mind, S.H.I.E.L.D. and even Iron Man have not been able to find any other areas of physical vulnerability. After his execution by Thor, Sentry spent an undefined period of time in the sun, burning down to an atom and reviving back endlessly until pulled out by the Apocalypse Twins. After having his head torn apart by Thor's Mjolnir in a surprise attack, Sentry simply reconstructed it within seconds. This invulnerability makes the Sentry, for all intents and purposes, immortal.</p><p><strong>Phasing/Intagible: </strong>Sentry has shown ability to phase through objects.</p><p><strong>Invisibility: </strong>Sentry can turn invisible by deflecting light and radiant emissions.</p><p><strong>Telepathy</strong>: According to Emma Frost, Sentry is one of the most powerful telepaths on earth. He once wiped the memory of his existence from every person on the planet. Most of Sentry's mental abilities are used to maintain his physical form.</p><p><strong>Resurrection</strong>: Under extreme emotional distress, Sentry can resurrect another being from death. This was first manifested when Sentry brought his wife back to life by just his touch. Originally, he was not even aware that he had this ability, and was shocked that he was capable of doing it. Sentry has not gained full control over this power, however.</p><p><strong>Shapeshifting: </strong>As Void he has shown ability to shape shift and change his own size.</p><p><strong>Empathy: </strong>Sentry has the ability to emit a wave of radiation that can calm the Hulk down.</p><p><strong>Matter Manipulation:</strong> After being blown apart by the witch Morgan Le Fay, Sentry later reformed at Avengers Tower under his own power. He was again thought to have been killed when his wife shot him with one of Noh-Varr's weapons, and twice was seemingly destroyed by Molecule Man. After his last apparent death at the hands of Molecule Man, Sentry came back with the realization that he could also control all forms of matter to a molecular level, much like Owen Reece. Following the revelation, the Sentry was able to use his power to beat Molecule Man with ease and then teleport him to an unknown location. The Sentry under the Apocalypse Deathseed has also been shown to construct rather large sand golems to attack a full sized Wasp, further showing off his matter manipulation abilities.</p><p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: As a horseman of death, he gained the ability to move object with his mind, being able to halt Thor's Mjolnir hurled at him only inches away from his face.</p><p><strong>Healing:</strong> The Sentry has shown that he has the ability to heal others. One example would be when he was able to heal his therapist daughter who was suffering from a catatonic state and had major spine issues during his second volume. The Sentry seems reluctant to use this ability, because according to him, he doesn't want to be seen as God. It is unknown what the true limits of this ability are.</p><p>During the Civil War, Spider-Man and a group of SHIELD agents ranked Sentry as the most powerful of all Earth's heroes, with the Hulk ranked as second and Black Bolt ranked as third after losing to the Hulk (though it should be noted that at this time Thor was dead, so he didn't have a place on the list). While this arbitrary ranking is at best debatable (particularly given the events of World War Hulk), the Sentry is nevertheless one of the most powerful meta-humans on the planet and has even been called a \"living H-Bomb\" by Norman Osborn.</p><p>In one instance he projected the Void as an entirely separate entity, a giant monster. This may suggest some form of light manipulation and the creation of hard-light constructs, but should more likely be attributed to his control over matter.</p><p>It is commonly believed that the Void has a larger variety of powers and is more powerful than the Sentry himself. However this is not true. The Sentry has defeated the Void on more than one occasion by pure physical force, displaying either a greater power level or a pure will that eclipses the Void's. Since the Void and Sentry are one and the same it could also be presumed that the Sentry shares the same powers that the Void does. With the reason Sentry is not using them is due to him restrainting on himself (whether it is his agoraphobia) or out of a decision to just not to use them. Since the \"death\" of the Void, Sentry is more stable, and displays greater power without its influence, also empowered by the Death Seed.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-2149: Marvel Zombies</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-264997\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.48\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:148.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-264997\"><img alt=\"Earth-2149 Zombieverse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Earth-2149 Zombieverse\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/264997-131741-sentry.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" data-width=\"432\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Earth-2149 Zombieverse</figcaption></figure><p>The infection started with an attack by an zombie version of Sentry from an alternate universe. He began eating those who were ascending into heaven until <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/ash/4005-11302/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-11302\">Ash</a> confronted him and shot him in the face using his shotgun. Unfazed, Sentry punched Ash so hard that he ripped through the fabric of reality, sucking both Ash and Sentry into the Earth-2149 universe. Warped into New York City, Sentry started looking for food. His first victims were the Avengers consisting of Colonel America, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/4005-1450/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1450\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/4005-1475/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1475\">Hawkeye</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/4005-3200/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3200\">Black Widow</a>, and Ms. Marvel, the first heroes at the scene of the crash site. Within a short time, the virus had reached almost every superhuman in the world. What happens to this Sentry after the world is consumed is unknown, but he may have opened another hole in the fabric of reality and escaped.</p><p>Later another man called Robert Reynolds, a powerless version from Earth 2149, appears as one of the few survivors alongside the acolytes. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/4005-1477/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1477\">Black Panther</a>, another uninfected hero, gives him the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wasp/4005-1502/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1502\">Wasp</a>'s head and tells him to be cautious or else he could be bitten. Years later an older version of Bob returns to earth in Marvel Zombies 2. Wasp appears, as well, on a suit designed by Bob which would later be used by Hawkeye.</p><p>When the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/4060-15411/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-15411\">Marvel Zombies</a> attack the Hulk, he reverts to Bruce Banner and is put under analysis by Bob. It is later revealed that Robert and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/forge/4005-4279/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4279\">Forge</a> used the body of T'Challa's son to host Colonel America's brain. This causes an attack on both by Black Panther, but he is stopped by the new Colonel, who almost killed him before being stopped by Bob. When the zombies return, the heroes, now with zombie Spider-Man and zombie Luke Cage on their side, fight the zombies in order to prevent them from entering the space ship where the last humans remain.</p><p>While repairing Luke and Spidey's injuries, Bob kisses Wasp and tells her how he truly feels about her. To the other heroes' surprise, Wasp's feelings are similar.</p><p>While on watch, Bob is attacked by the zombie Bruce Banner who had somehow managed to escape from his prison. The attack makes Bob to accidentally open the force field, but he eventually escapes. The zombies realize their hunger is gone, but this revelation is soon interrupted by an attack from zombie Hulk, who attempts to feed on the humans. Though his fellow zombies try to convince him to stop, Hulk doesn't listen and a fight begins once again. Though the zombies fight valiantly, Hulk starts to gain the upper hand and kills <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/firelord/4005-7108/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-7108\">Firelord</a>, Iron Man, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/4005-3552/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3552\">Phoenix</a>, and Hawkeye.</p><p>After their deaths, Bob arrives and sacrifices himself to the Hulk. Black Panther tries to stop him, but Bob says that it's the only way to stop Hulk, and that he has no reason to live anymore since he believes Wasp was killed by Goliath. After devouring Bob, the zombie Hulk reverts back to Bruce Banner who asks for the others kill him. The zombies agree in order to avoid another attack on the humans. Goliath is seen with the remains of Wasp, only a head now, and asks for her forgiveness. Wasp answers by saying that Bob was the greatest man she ever knew and that he cared for everyone equally. Goliath answers \"You always knew how to make me feel small.\"</p><h3>Earth-58163: House of M</h3><p>Sentry is seen in therapy with Dr. Strange as his therapist.

This gives Sentry time to regain his power before the fight at Asgard. This leads to Sentry having enough power to kill the Avengers and anyone who stands in his way. Doctor Doom tries to counter Sentry by using Emma Frost to prove to him that <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/bullseye/4005-4647/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4647\">Bullseye </a>killed his wife under orders from Norman. But instead of just turning on Norman, this act releases the Void from inside Sentry, and the Void kills Norman before taking over the rest of the world.</p><h3>Marvel Team Up Vol 3 # 15 (Reality - 6215)</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3311950\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.23221936589546\" data-width=\"1167\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1167px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:23.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3311950\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 1167w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 1167w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/10/102593/3311950-01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>In this alternate reality a powerful nemesis called Chronok came to Earth and killed its heroes.

Tony cared only about himself, but he would have a change of heart after he was kidnapped by terrorists and gravely injured. Pressured to create a weapon of mass destruction, Stark instead created a suit of armor powerful enough for him to escape. Tony used his vast resources and intellect to make the world a better place as The Invincible Iron Man. Stark's super hero identity led him to become a founding member of the Avengers.",

In his youth, Tony Stark was a precociously intelligent young boy. When Tony was 7 he was sent to a boarding school, and during this experience he found people difficult to relate to. This was when he became fascinated by machines. By the age of 15 Tony had enrolled in MIT (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in Boston, Massachusetts. He graduated at the top of his class at age 19 with double masters in physics and engineering.</p><p>At the age of 21, his parents were tragically killed in a car accident. Afterwards, Tony inherited Stark Industries, an unparalleled mega-conglomerate that mostly manufactured weapons for the United States military. One of his first projects as the new CEO was to purchase the manufacturer who designed his parents' car and have the faulty brake system, which was seemingly the cause of their deaths, redesigned in order to prevent any further incidents, thus saving lives. Unknown to Stark, the true architect of his parents' deaths was a business move by Republic Oil (later renamed Roxxon Oil). Lacking in business skills, Tony promoted secretary Pepper Potts to be his executive assistant and left the majority of his workload on her so that he could avoid what he saw as a burden.</p><p>During the war in Afghanistan, Stark was at one of his munitions plants testing new technology for the military when he was injured by his own land mine that lodged shrapnel near his heart. Tony was then captured by a local warlord named Wong-Chu (a lackey of the Mandarin) and forced under threat of death to create a doomsday weapon for him with another captive, the famed Nobel award-winning physicist, Yin Sen. The shrapnel was going to enter his heart and kill him, but he and the physicist created an arc reactor which kept the shrapnel away from his heart. In response, Tony built a suit of armor to help himself escape captivity. In the suit, Stark took on the warlord and his men and avenged Yin Sen's death, thus Iron Man was born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tony Stark made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. He was created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby. Tony's character was loosely based on the life of the rich and successful playboy Howard Hughes. It may be argued that Iron Man symbolized the meritocracy of capitalism. In the 1960's when Iron Man was created, the threat of Communism from the USSR was huge. Not only did Iron Man fight communists and people from the Eastern Block, but he sent the message that great things could be achieved through thrift, risk and hard work, as opposed to Spider-Man's origin story a year previous whereby Peter Parker gained powers from being bitten by a spider.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>When Marvel re-emerged on the comic book scene in the Silver Age (some say Marvel's re-emergence signaled the beginning of the Silver Age of Comics) a big factor in their popularity was making easily relatable characters. In many cases, this took the form of a teenage hero for whom others felt some empathy (as at the time readership was primarily for those of a younger age.) Such heroes included the X-Men and Spider-Man. When it came to portraying more mature characters, there was still an emphasis on portraying the character's humanity as much as their heroics. In the case of Tony Stark, this took on essentially two different aspects. He had to battle alcoholism and re-organize his company so as not to be a war profiteer any longer. Over the course of his publication history, he has had to deal with both aspects of his life.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>James Rhodes</h3><p>After fleeing from enemy territory Tony met and befriended the pilot James Rhodes who had been shot down in his helicopter. By working together, they were able to make their escape and upon arriving back in the United States, Tony decided to continue being Iron Man in order to fight injustice. He believed that he had a limited amount of time left to live due to his injury, and therefore wanted to make the most of it. Therefore, he began making vast improvements to the technology of his power armor.</p><h3>Secret Identity</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2786640\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.1473384030418\" data-width=\"1052\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1052px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2786640\"><img alt=\"Original armor painted gold.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 1052w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117763/2786640-tumblr_mg2i8vlsbv1qiknbco1_1280.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Original armor painted gold.</figcaption></figure><p>When Tony finally admitted his double identity to his fiancee Joanna Nivena, she encouraged him to use the armor to become a super hero and save lives. Iron Man began to establish himself as one of the U.S.'s most eminent super heroes, but while halting a breakout of lions and tigers from a circus, Tony saw how his armor frightened the people he was defending. Asking his date Marion what she would do if she were Iron Man, Tony painted his armor in stainless gold. Tony Stark allowed the public at large to believe that he was no more than a rich playboy while his identity as Iron Man would remain a secret. Since Iron Man was often seen at Stark Industries, Tony circulated the idea that Iron Man was his personal bodyguard. Stark, of course, still had his heart condition which meant that any day could potentially be his last. Luckily for him, his heart condition became publicly known and he was eventually healed by way of an artificial heart transplant.</p><p>When testing his \"Stark Special\" race car, Tony wound up in a wreck, but was saved at the last minute by ex-boxer Harry \"Happy\" Hogan . To repay Happy, Tony hired him as a chauffeur, although Happy became more like a bodyguard, resenting Iron Man. At the same time, former Stark Industries scientist Gregor Shapanka menaced Tony as Jack Frost (later renamed Blizzard), a villain who could generate ice. Happy would often try to play for Pepper's affection, but she was more interested in Tony. However, as Tony's heart could fail at any time, he didn't want to commit himself to a serious relationship since he could die unexpectedly. Happy remained extremely faithful to Tony, telling Iron Man straight out that if he had harmed Tony he would regret it during a period in which Iron Man was thought to have killed Tony. Happy even almost died when delivering a device to Iron Man that would stop Titanium Man.</p><h3>Formation of the Avengers</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181917\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.4325\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181917\"><img alt=\"Iron Man along with the Avengers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man along with the Avengers.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181917-45469-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" data-width=\"400\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man along with the Avengers.</figcaption></figure><p>When Loki framed the Hulk for wrecking a train in the hope that Thor would battle him, the Hulk's friend Rick Jones sent a message to the Fantastic Four asking for their help. Loki then diverted the message to Thor. What he didn't realize was that Iron Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp had also intercepted it. After Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, Wasp and Iron Man all defeated Loki together, Ant-Man suggested that the five of them stay together as a team, and the Wasp dubbed them the Avengers. Shortly afterwards, after a fight with the Space Phantom, the Hulk decided to quit since he thought no one trusted him. Whilst in pursuit of the Hulk and Namor (whom he had teamed up with), the Avengers came upon the body of Captain America, a legendary World War II fighter. The Avengers accepted him into their ranks, and he became close friends with Iron Man. Iron Man even gave Captain America transistors to control the flight of his shield, although Captain America later discarded them since they upset the balance of the shield. After a fight with the original Masters of Evil which ended with Baron Heinrich Zemo being killed, Iron Man, Giant-Man, Wasp and Thor all decided to take their leave since they needed a break. Captain America stayed on and became the new leader of the Avengers, which now consisted of himself, Hawkeye, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch.</p><h3>Early Encounters</h3><p>When Tony was targeted by the mysterious villain Mr. Doll, who was forcing millionaires to give their funds to him, he was completely powerless against Mr. Doll's power to cause pain using a mystic doll (similar to voodoo). In order to defeat Mr. Doll, Tony completely redesigned his armor into light fitting armor rather than his previously heavy and bulky Armor. With this new armor, he was able to defeat Mr. Doll in a rematch.</p><p>Iron Man initially fought primarily against enemies that were a threat to him or his company, such as The Mandarin, The Melter, The Ghost, and Spymaster. He also fought against communist enemies (the 1960's, when Iron Man first debuted, was a time of unparalleled anti-communism) such as The Crimson Dynamo, (the first of who would defect to the U.S.A. and later gave up his life to stop the second Crimson Dynamo) Black Widow (who would later defect to the US), The Titanium Man, and others. Iron Man was also one of the founding members of the Avengers and, with Tony’s fortune, he was able to fund the team through the Maria Stark Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization named after his late mother. He also donated the use of his boyhood manor which became Avengers Mansion, staffed by <a href=\"/jarvis/4005-1781/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1781\">Edwin Jarvis</a>.</p><h3>Alcoholism</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4512530\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.89737470167064\" data-width=\"419\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 419px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4512530\"><img alt=\"Tony and his Addiction.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-width=\"419\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg 419w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony and his Addiction.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512530-ironm.jpg 419w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 419px) 100vw, 419px\" data-width=\"419\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony and his Addiction.</figcaption></figure><p>Over time, Tony evolved into a more complex and vulnerable individual as his dual life as a superhero caused him numerous personal problems. He became the victim of corporate takeovers, and would lose and rebuild his fortune multiple times. Tony would also eventually be led to an alcohol addiction when he discovered that SHIELD, who he had previously supported, was seeking to buy controlling stocks in his company, thus ensuring his continued weapons development for them.</p><p>Later, Tony would become bankrupt and homeless when he lost his company to his rival, Obadiah Stane, who had been manipulating him for some time. During this event, his friend James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes even took on the mantle of Iron Man. Stark would begin rebuilding his fortune when he created a company named Circuits Maximus, which specialized in computer technology. While this was happening, Rhodes was slowly going mad while using the Iron Man armor since its unique interface was designed for Stark's nervous system, and not his own. He eventually succumbs and goes on a rampage. This caused Tony to use a prototype armor that was not yet finished in order to stop Rhodey from causing any more destruction.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4512531\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.86839481555334\" data-width=\"1003\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1003px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4512531\"><img alt=\"Tony Seeks Help.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 1003w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony Seeks Help.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 1003w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11121/111219164/4512531-ironm2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony Seeks Help.</figcaption></figure><p>Following this incident, Rhodes repeatedly tried to convince Tony to resume the Iron Man mantle but he kept refusing. Now somewhat fearful of his past alcoholism and how Stane had taken advantage of it, Tony felt that he had grown dependent upon the armour, whilst he had \"rotted\" on the inside. As a result, Tony didn't feel worthy of the high-tech armour which Rhodes used and relied on a suit of armour which visually looked almost exactly the same as his original, grey armour (but which was much more sophisticated). As Tony continued fighting crime in this suit, Stane realized that Tony wasn't as beaten as he had assumed, and repeatedly tried various tactics to destroy Tony and make him sink into alcoholism once more. This all culminated in Stane kidnapping many of Tony's allies and friends, and bombing Circuits Maximus. As a result of this bombing, Rhodes was injured too badly to use his suit of armour, and Tony's friend Morley Erwin was killed. Obadiah Stane incorrectly assumed that as a result of all his machinations, Tony would feel that he had failed and take up drinking again to cope.</p><h3>The Silver Armor &amp; Stane's Final Fate</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851488\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.3327205882353\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851488\"><img alt=\"Tony's Silver Armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg 544w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony's Silver Armor\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg 544w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/5586/1851488-im3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony's Silver Armor</figcaption></figure><p>Instead, Tony finished developing a brand new suit of armor (nicknamed the Silver Centurion) which he had been working on for months, and confronted Stane face to face.

Although Stane had an abundance of ways in which he planned to defeat Stark, Tony overcame each obstacle and managed to send Stane running.

Tony would develop a way to disable the armors of everyone else who used technology based on his designs and thus began the Armor Wars. Tony would even disable SHIELD armored technology known as the Mandroids that he had designed for their use, which causes the US Government to go after Iron Man as public enemy #1 and a threat to national security. Tony eluded capture by fooling them into believing that Iron Man had gone rogue. However Tony's good friend, both in and outside the armour, Captain America wasn't fooled and tried to persuade Tony from taking on the US Government. Tony pretended to comply but, in the end, continued his crusade, even going so far as to electrocute Captain America once he tried stopping him physically. Although Cap wasn't hurt badly in any way, this created some friction between the two which lasted for quite awhile. Tony then attacked Stingray, an armored government employee and ally of the Avengers. He realized his mistake after finding that Stingray's suit was not derived from his stolen tech, and ended up \"firing\" Iron Man in order to get the press and public off his back.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1536254\" data-ratio=\"1.3812010443864\" data-width=\"383\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 383px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.1%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1536254\"><img alt=\"Tony's new armor after the Armor Wars.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-width=\"463\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg 383w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony's new armor after the Armor Wars.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5586/1536254-im1.jpg 383w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" data-width=\"463\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony's new armor after the Armor Wars.</figcaption></figure><p>During the battle with Firepower, the final armored opponent using his tech, Tony faked the death of the rogue Iron Man.

This tactic aroused suspicion and caused major distrust, especially when he tried to \"re-join\" the Avengers.</p><h3>War Machine</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-173121\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"1.43\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG\" data-ref-id=\"1300-173121\"><img alt=\"Tony's War Machine\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony's War Machine\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/4312/173121-43286-war-machine.JPG 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony's War Machine</figcaption></figure><p>While Stark is continuing to use the Iron Man armor he discovers that its interface design was causing severe damage to his nervous system. He began remotely controlling the Iron Man armors, but after a failed mission against the Masters of Silence, he realizes that controlling the Iron Man armor is not as effective as being inside it. This leads to Tony designing the War Machine Armor, previously dubbed as the “Variable Threat Response Battle Suit.” His nervous system would continue to deteriorate however, even to the point where it was life-threatening. Tony had to fake his own death and be put into suspended animation in order to survive. Even close friends like James Rhodes were unaware of his faked death, and when he would later reveal the deception it would cause a serious rift in their relationship. Also during this time, James Rhodes would watch over the company and continue Iron Man’s career by using the “Variable Threat Response Battle Suit.”</p><p>Of course Tony would eventually awaken and survive with a chip he programmed and implanted in himself. An enraged Rhodes takes the “Variable Threat Response Battle Suit” and begins his own career as the hero known as War Machine. Tony continues his super hero career and eventually gets into a feud with the Avengers after the Kree/Shi'ar War, resulting in him quitting the team. Tony would create a new group called Force Works, but eventually left that team as well because of another falling out. After some time, Iron Man would decide to reconcile with the Avengers and he rejoins them.</p><h3>The Crossing</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916057\" data-ratio=\"1.4915611814346\" data-width=\"474\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 474px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:149.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916057\"><img alt=\"The Death of Tony Stark\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" data-width=\"429\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg 474w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg 429w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Death of Tony Stark\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg 474w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/113509/5916057-9203796854-Cross.jpg 429w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px\" data-width=\"429\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Death of Tony Stark</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark was later revealed as an unwitting traitor to the Avengers while under the control of Kang the Conqueror, who had been using Stark as an unwilling undercover agent for several years. Kang used Iron Man to kill many innocent lives and other heroes, such as Rita DeMara, and his other Avenger teammates. The Avengers traveled back in time to recruit a teenage Tony Stark to fight the present-day Tony, and Kang. The teen Tony was able to steal an Iron Man armor from his older self and used it in battle against him. During the battle, the present-day Tony Stark would regain his memories and realize what he had been forced to do. As a result, he ended up sacrificing himself in order to kill Kang. The teenage Tony Stark would stay in the present time line following Iron Man's death, and continued his life as the new Iron Man. As for Stark’s company, it was sold to a Japanese rival named Fujikawa Industries.</p><h3>Onslaught &amp; Heroes Reborn</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916059\" data-ratio=\"1.5422077922078\" data-width=\"308\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 308px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5916059\"><img alt=\"Iron Man Reborn\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-width=\"308\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg 308w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man Reborn\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5916059-7545689448-70781.jpg 308w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" data-width=\"308\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man Reborn</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately for the teenage Tony, Onslaught arrived soon after and it prevented him from gaining greater control over his life. In the final battle, many of the heroes of the Marvel Universe, including the teenage Tony, sacrificed themselves in order to defeat Onslaught. Luckily for them, Franklin Richards had created a pocket universe with all the heroes in it.

Also, Tony was brought back to his normal adult age but still retained the teenage Tony’s memories. Tony also gained the help of Daredevil and his law firm associate, Foggy Nelson. They helped him regain ownership of his company and assets. Next, Tony reconciled with the Avengers and rejoined the team.</p><p>While trying to save an android by downloading its program into his power suit, the Iron Man armor was influenced by Ultron who had embedded himself in the androids systems without the android knowing. Ultron used the armor to cause Tony to go into a cardiac arrest after a shock from villain Whiplash. That shock awoke the suit and gave it a mind of its own. It knew that Tony was in cardiac arrest and saved him. Tony welcomed the live armor until it committed murder, and until it began wanting to merge itself with Tony, making him a human machine. Tony decided to battle the armor that had gained a mind of its own. During the battle however, Tony suffered another heart attack. The armor, which still cared about its creator, decided to save him and gave Tony its own cybernetic heart, replacing his own. This worked effectively but meant that Tony had to constantly recharge the battery power in order to keep his new heart functioning. After this incident, Tony decided to return to his original armor.</p><p>Tony would fall in love with a woman named Rumiko Fujikawa, the daughter of the man who had previously taken over his company. She only began dating him to rebel against her father however, and did not truly share his feelings for her. Due to the lack of any real intimacy between the two, their relationship soon became tumultuous, with Rumiko even cheating on Tony with one of his business rivals because she thought he had become boring. Strangely, Rumiko was murdered by an Iron Man impostor.</p><h3>Public Identity Revealed and Secretary of Defense</h3><p>Stark would later reveal his identity to the world when saving a puppy from a speeding car since he was unable to completely mask himself in time. Afterwards, Tony discovered that the Government was once again using his technology, and was able to do so legally due to a copyright loophole that Tony exposed himself to by revealing his secret identity. Tony decided to accept a Presidential appointment to serve as the President's new Secretary of Defense so that he could monitor and direct the use of his technology by the Government.</p><h3>Avengers Disassembled &amp; Extremis</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181179\" data-ratio=\"1.505\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181179\"><img alt=\"Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/77/181179-164296-new-avengers.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 425px) 100vw, 425px\" data-width=\"425\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony helps Cap form the New Avengers.</figcaption></figure><p>During Avengers Disassembled, in which the Scarlet Witch goes insane and kills several of her teammates on the Avengers, Wanda made Tony Stark confront the Ambassador of Latveria while drunk at the United Nations. After this incident, Tony was forced to resign his duties as Secretary of Defense. Later, Stark claimed to be stepping down as Iron Man as well while someone else was stepping into the role, thus allowing him to continue operating as Iron Man in secret. Also during this event, Avengers Mansion was destroyed which had been Tony's boyhood manor up until he donated it to the Avengers to be the teams base of operations.

Extremis allows Stark to store the inner layers of the new Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones, and to control the armor through direct brain impulses. Extremis also integrates Stark's existing lock-chip (a personal networking implement implanted in his forearm) directly into his nervous system. Once achieved, Tony's abilities as Iron Man are significantly increased. He now has the ability to communicate with his suit much faster than any normal human reaction time.</p><h3><b>Civil War</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-650259\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.81233243967828\" data-width=\"373\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 373px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.2%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-650259\"><img alt=\"Iron Man and Cap during Civil War\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" data-width=\"373\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg 373w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man and Cap during Civil War\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/25835/650259-imvscap.jpg 373w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" data-width=\"373\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man and Cap during Civil War</figcaption></figure><p>It was revealed that Stark, in the days following the Kree- Skrull war had formed a secret society or group called the Illuminati, which is a governing body of super heroes. The other members of this still functioning group consist of Mr. Fantastic, Professor X, Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, and Namor. Their first meeting was in Wakanda where the group also offered membership to the Black Panther, whom politely rejected it. However, although the rest of the members had different views and did not believe that an alliance like this would be of much use, they still agree to work together and at least share information. In one case, shortly before the events of Civil War, the Illuminati decided to launch the Hulk into outer space feeling. He soon found out that the government was making decisions on the Super Human Registration Act. At first, Stark is very much against the idea, even going so far as to hire the Titanium Man to attack him in order to manipulate public opinion in his favor. Tony also tries to talk the government out of Registration but his appeal is ignored after the tragedy at Stamford, Connecticut, in which members of the New Warriors confronted a villain named Nitro in a residential neighborhood, setting off an explosion that killed many innocent lives. When the heroes unite in the face of this tragedy in Stamford , they move around some of the rubble to find if there are any survivors. Meanwhile, Tony tells Wolverine who has caught Nitro’s scent to go after him. The trail leaves cold next to the water, but Iron Man lets Wolverine borrow one of his suits to traverse underwater.</p><p>After the Stamford incident and another in which Tony's armors are hacked and used to attack innocent people, Stark reconsiders his position and the morality of super human registration. He reversed his decision and publicly spearheading the support for the Super-human Registration Act. Support among the super hero community is mixed however, and the conflict leads to the Civil War in the Marvel Universe.</p><p>Stark was able to convince many heroes including Spider-Man to join the pro-registration side and ban the law. Tony also convinced Spider-Man to show the whole world his identity. They begin to hunt down heroes who on the anti-registration side who have gone rogue, led by Captain America. Tony also worked with Mr. Fantastic to build a prison in the The Negative Zone to hold rogue superhumans, but many heroes begin to question the methods of Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic when a Thor clone they created kills Bill Foster, the second Goliath, a friend on the anti-registration side, the combined trauma of witnessing Foster's death, the firsthand view of the Prison 42 and a heated fight with Captain America causes Spider-Man to see the error of his ways. He publicly admits his mistake and joins Captain America's anti-reg forces much to Iron Man's anger. Further questions about their motives arise when it is discovered that they are using former villains to hunt down anti-registration forces. When the anti-registration heroes decide to attack the Negative Zone, it triggers the final battle of the Civil War. While Iron Man is facing off against Captain America his armor is shut down by the Vision. Captain America begins savagely beating Iron Man until he realizes the damage that the war has caused. Captain America then decides to surrender in order to prevent any more bloodshed but still refuses to register. Afterwards, Maria concedes her position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>While Captain America was being brought into SHIELD custody he was shot by Crossbones, later revealed to be working for the Red Skull. Many of the anti-registration heroes even go so far as to presume Iron Man to be involved with regards to Steve’s death. While Iron Man was grieving over Steve’s dead body in a SHIELD facility, Wolverine breaks in and tells Stark that if I ever found him to be involved in any way to Steve’s death, he will personally kill him.</p><p>Later, Iron Man decides that there must always be a Captain America and that the dream must live on. He asks the newly resurrected Hawkeye if he would like to take over the mantle. Hawkeye refuses and eventually Bucky is given the role.</p><h3><b>World War Hulk</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3949551\" data-ratio=\"1.5444947209653\" data-width=\"663\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 663px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.4%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3949551\"><img alt=\"Hulk vs. Iron Man in the HulkBuster Armor.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 663w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 621w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hulk vs. Iron Man in the HulkBuster Armor.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 663w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 621w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11112/111126656/3949551-6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hulk vs. Iron Man in the HulkBuster Armor.</figcaption></figure><p>As stated, before the start of the Civil War, Iron Man and several other members of the secret group of heroes known as the Illuminati deemed the Hulk a threat to Earth due to the destruction which accompanied his many rampages. The Illuminati lured the Hulk into a space-faring vessel and launched him into outer space in order to send him to a world where his power would not be a threat to the sanctity of innocent lives. The World War Hulk story occurs upon his return as the Hulk seeks revenge on Iron Man and the other Illuminati members.</p><p>Tony Stark is the first hero to confront the Hulk upon his return, hoping to prevent any further loss of life on Earth. Donning a modified \"Hulkbuster\" armor, Iron Man engages the Hulk in combat in Manhattan (whose population was previously evacuated to safety by S.H.I.E.L.D. upon Stark's orders). Iron Man makes an attempt to use specially designed nanobots to deactivate the Hulk's powers, but this proves unsuccessful due to the nanobots being sabotaged beforehand by a member of the Initiative. His new Hulkbuster armor and Stark Tower are destroyed in the battle that ensues. While being held captive in Madison Square Garden arena, Tony Stark manages to contact Dum Dum Dugan via his extremis enhanced powers and informs Dugan of a last resort plan to prevent the Hulk from attacking the rest of the world. The plan is to send the entirety of Manhattan into the Negative Zone. The plan would have the affect of killing himself, the Hulk, the Warbound, and all heroes and agents on the island. He trusts Dugan to know if and when he should execute the plan. Stark is later seen fighting with his fellow Illuminati members in the arena, defeating a gigantic tentacle monster. After the battle, the Hulk forces Tony and Mr. Fantastic to face off in combat via the obedience disks implanted into each of them. Mr. Fantastic defeats Tony, and the Hulk orders him to kill Stark. It was in that instant that the Sentry came in the arena and begin to battle the Hulk and after Hulk goes on a berserker rampage over the wounding of his friend, Rick Jones, by his fellow Warbound, Miek, Stark orders his satellite to fire a gamma inducing energy onto the Hulk, thus knocking him unconscious.</p><h3>Murder Inc.</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073340\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.2086167800454\" data-width=\"441\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 441px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073340\"><img alt=\"Mayhem in the Philippines\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg 441w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mayhem in the Philippines\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg 441w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/43640/1073340-mayhem.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mayhem in the Philippines</figcaption></figure><p><b>For More Information: The Invincible Iron Man</b></p><p>Swiftly dealing with the entirety of the members of AGM, Iron Man faced their leader, MODOK, and had little trouble into dispatching him to space, and shutting down their operation. Concerned that all the members of AGM lacked passion, and zealotry, he was certain that they were not the ones behind the massacre. The prediction proved accurate once again, when, during an honorary ceremony in , another set of repulsor technology infused suicide terrorists, this time disguised as monks, caused mass destruction, and killed all the members of the country’s heroic squad.</p><p>Once there to investigate, Iron Man, War Machine and Pepper confirmed Tony’s suspicions, with more clues that the technology was repulsor based, but also improving and growing at a significant rate. The man behind it all was none other than Ezekiel “Zeke” Stane, the teenage son of Tony’s old adversary, Obadiah Stane (a.k.a. the Iron Monger). Who, with the use of cheap Stark based technology equipment he acquired from black market exchanges, was methodically trying to destroy Tony’s operations from the root, and most importantly, end his Tony’s life.</p><p>Putting the investigation for the culprit of the two suicide bombings aside for a while, Tony and Pepper attended a charity gala at Tony’s penthouse in. After a small argument, Pepper stepped outside the building, with Tony coming after her. He was then stopped by Zeke Stane himself, who had managed to sneak in the building. Distracting Tony for a while, he achieved his true goal: another set of suicide bombers entered the building, and everyone inside was caught up in a huge explosion.</p><h3>Pepper Potts At The End Of The World</h3><p><b>For More Information: The Invincible Iron Man</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073343\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.48275862068966\" data-width=\"609\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 609px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073343\"><img alt=\"Man on Fire\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 609w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Man on Fire\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 609w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/43640/1073343-on_fire.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Man on Fire</figcaption></figure><p>Managing to activate the Extremis under sheath, and call his armor from the other room in virtually no time, Tony not only managed to escape, but also see the figure of Zeke Stane, sarcastically smirking at him, at the exact point of the detonation. Searching for Pepper, he located her through her Stark ID badge, buried under the debris. As he watched the ambulance carrying Pepper away from the scene, Tony was stunned to see another survivor: Zeke Stane himself. Tony was certain that Stane was the man behind the attacks, but had no substantial proof of it. Stane on the other hand, escaped the medical facility he was kept in after causing significant mayhem. It was revealed that Stane had undergone a procedure enabling him to store far greater amounts of energy to his body, and channeling the energy as a weapon through his hands, but the intense amounts of heat, caused his skin to burn out. As a solution, Zeke decided it was time to create a uniform in order to absorb and redirect the energy from his body.</p><p>In the meantime, Tony was informed that Pepper’s condition was critical – a shrapnel penetrated her chest cavity, and was closing into her heart. Adding the other injuries she sustained during the explosion, made an operation about the removal of the shrapnel, impossible. Determined to save Pepper, Tony awaited for her to regain consciousness in order to explain the situation, and offer her a solution: adding a derivation of the repulsor that kept him alive after his own accident years go, to her chest, to prevent the shrapnel from reaching her heart, while she was recuperating. Later on, Tony went to , where another explosion took place. At that time, and while giving Maria Hill insight about his past with Zeke’s father, Obadiah, Tony started to suspect that Zeke had been using parts from his own original technology to achieve what he had done. Scanning the site for Starktech, he found one more damaged repulsor, what came to be Zeke’s trademark, until that point. Tony’s search came to an abrupt end after he was attacked by remote controlled androids, commanded by Chinese agents, while accused of unauthorized access. Defeating them without much trouble, Tony headed back to Pepper’s side, where the doctor informed him that all went well. Little did Tony know that Zeke Stane had managed to complete his suit by that point, and was setting up the final pieces in order to retract his revenge against him.</p><h3>Irrational Actors</h3><p><b>For More Information: The Invincible Iron Man</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073351\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.9846547314578\" data-width=\"391\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 391px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:98.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073351\"><img alt=\"A Painful Price\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" data-width=\"391\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg 391w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Painful Price\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/43640/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man.jpg 391w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px\" data-width=\"391\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Painful Price</figcaption></figure><p>Knowing that with the evacuations half completed, more lives would be at stake had Stane decided to order the other hits swiftly after the one in , Tony remotely controlled an empty armor to fight off Stane, while he was closing in to the facility himself. It was then that, in a stroke of genius, he proved what he meant in his earlier conversation with Reed Richards: He needed to be in four places at once. He needed to be an army. And by using the spare units in his armory, he did just that. Using the armors to contain damage, help in the evacuations, locate and prevent the suicide bombers from going off, and stopping Stane from giving the OK for the bombings to proceed, he handled every task at hand successfully. In the meanwhile, Stane, realizing he had been played, and gave the OK for the hits to start, while fighting off multiple older armors. It was at that point that Tony finally arrived at the scene, landing on top of Stane himself, and bracing for the final fight. Quickly immobilizing him, Tony asked him to cal off the hits, but Zeke refused. Holding yet another ace up his sleeve, Tony had planted devices in each location, to unleash electromagnetic pulses, and thus shutting down every piece of Stark equipment, from regular computers and advanced suits of armor, to even the suicide bombers. The fight continued without armors, neither for Tony, nor for Stane, with Iron Man finally putting Zeke down, mano-a-mano. With the entire crisis avoided, Iron Man could not help but think that Stane actually provided him with a fifth nightmare: what kind of a man he had to become, in order to stop his four nightmares from coming true, and the price with which those actions came to pass.</p><h3>The Mighty Avengers</h3><p>Iron Man as the Director of SHIELD is also given access to form a government sponsored Avengers team. He meets up with Ms. Marvel and tells her that she is to be the team leader. Together they become the poster boy and girl for the registration side and handpick the Avengers using the compiled database. Iron Man visits Thor in Asgard to both ask him to register and became an Avenger again. Thor defeats Tony and causes his armor to malfunction. He states that he no longer complies to man’s laws and that if Iron Man ever came to Asgard again he would get an even worse welcome next time. Tony then asks him how is get back home where Thor tells him to walk.</p><p>In assembling the Avengers, Iron Man states that they need a “Thor” and a “Wolverine” to which Carol that she knows someone who is both a Thor and a Wolverine. They go together to recruit Ares, God of War who is doing construction work. Iron Man threatens him to register with the government and join the Avengers and that if doesn’t comply he will get a beating along with his cover being blown amongst his coworkers. Ares states that Tony is bluffing and that he can’t defeat him. Tony wonders how Ares will fare against multiple opponents at Iron Man's level or above. Ares is somewhat amused by Tony’s attitude and states that if he will match his pay in the Avengers, then he will join. Iron Man and Ms. Marvel also select the Wasp, Wonder Man, Black Widow, and the Sentry (whom Iron Man states needs guidance although Carol is initially opposed to the idea). Together, they confront some very serious threats such as Ultron and Doctor Doom. The team is later disbanded in the aftermath of Secret Invasion, and Tony becomes a wanted man.</p><h3><b>Secret Invasion</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516866\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5175\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-516866\"><img alt=\"Tony the Skrull?!\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tony the Skrull?!\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26163/516866-322219_114945_secret_invasion_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Tony the Skrull?!</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark survives but is later confronted while in the hospital by Spider-Woman who reveals a dead Skrull that had been impersonating Elektra. Tony has Spider-Woman join his Avengers squad, and gathers the Illuminati in order to inform them of the impending invasion. Fellow Illuminati member, Black Bolt, is also revealed to be a Skrull, but is killed by Namor. Afterwards a squadron of Skrulls attack. The Illuminati are forced to kill the Skrulls during the ensuing battle. In the aftermath, the Illuminati members realize they can no longer trust even each other since they cannot tell who is real and who is a Skrull importer. They go their separate ways, hoping to defeat the Skrulls on their own terms. Tony also wonders if Captain America during Civil War was a Skrull.</p><p>When an unidentified flying object lands in the Savage Land, Stark summons the Avengers to go and investigate. However, the unregistered heroes beat them to it and Iron man arrives just as soon as Luke Cage is about to open the door to the spaceship. Stark tells Cage to back off and that he is to be arrested. Luke Cage states that Stark’s repulsor beam can’t hurt him and that the real Stark would know that, implying that Iron Man is a Skrull. The two Avengers teams are about to go into a brawl, but Jarvis revealed to be a Skrull imposter deactivates Iron Man armor which electrocutes Tony inside. Meanwhile, the door to the spaceship opens and various heroes emerge sporting their classic incarnations.</p><p>The emerged heroes accuse the ones standing outside to all be Skrulls. This quickly turns into a battle but the characters get scattered once a dinosaur rampages through. Iron Man tells Ms. Marvel to head back to the city as he suspects that this was a successful trap to get the Avengers far away from the main action. Ms. Marvel states that she can bring him back as well but he states that it will be faster if she goes alone. Carol flies off and Iron Man heads towards his lab in the Savage Land to repair his armor. He is followed into his lab by Spider-woman, who reveals her herself to be the Skrull Queen Veranke. She states that Stark is a Skrull sleeper agent and he has done his job well preparing for the invasion. In efforts to break him, she kisses him telling him that he volunteered for this and that she promised to personally end his misery once his mission was completed. Just when she is about to kill him, Black Widow and Wolverine break in and save Stark whereas the Queen decides to retreat.</p><p>Black Widow injects the defeated Stark with a dose of adrenaline and questions him about where his allegiance lies. He states that sleeper agent or not, he doesn’t believe in the Skrulls ideology and will fight against them. Meanwhile, Mr. Fantastic is able to build a new Skrull detecting device as the previous ones proved to be outdated in use against them. He arrives on the Savage Land and scans the proximity of the area which reveals that all the heroes that emerged from the spaceship to be Skrulls. They are quickly defeated and the heroes return back to the city to confront the final climactic battle of the Invasion. Iron Man gathers some of his old equipment and rushes off to Central Park where the Skrull force has united for a final confrontation. He calls for the Avengers to assemble but they are also united with the rogue Avengers, Nick Fury, Thor, Captain America and even villains such as the Thunderbolts and the Hood. During the battle, Norman Osborn is able to get the killing shot on the Skrull Queen, which literally becomes the shot heard around the world thanks to media coverage of the event. Public opinion of Osborn changes into that of a patriot and a war hero whereas Iron Man's becomes synonymous to failure.</p><p>Once, the Skrull Queen is murdered, the Skrulls begin to lose faith in the prophecy that states Earth to be their new home. They begin to retreat but many are thwarted by the Skrull Captain Marvel who doesn't believe in their ideology and War Machine whom is sent by Iron Man. While destroying Skrull ships, War Machine finds many of the replaced heroes during the Skrull infiltration such as Elektra, Hank Pym, Spider-woman, Mockingbird and Dum Dum Dugan. War Machine is able to safely transport them back to Earth. Secret Invasion does not end without its casualties however and one of the most notable Avenger, the Wasp dies while attempting to use the size changing device that the Skrull Pym gave her. Iron Man attends her funeral and gives a speech honoring her memory and stating that far too many of their best have fallen in recent years including Steve. Hank Pym, however, cuts Tony’s speech short by interrupting and stating that he is very much responsible for their deaths. He also states why it is so that Tony hasn't died; Tony has no answer but feels his lost just the same. Finding this to be an opportune moment, Osborn also attending the funeral offers membership to Hank for his new Avengers. Hank curses him out in public and leaves.</p><h3><b>Dark Reign</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632930\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.1457142857143\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632930\"><img alt=\"Most Wanted\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 700w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Most Wanted\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 700w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/24370/632930-dark_reign_event_20081204000212325_1_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Most Wanted</figcaption></figure><p>In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded and replaced with the agency known as H.A.M.M.E.R. Both Tony and Maria Hill lose their positions in favor of Osborn. On Tony's last day, Osborn questions him about the Superhuman Registration database and how he could access it. Stark tells Norman that he would be breaking the law and thus would need to get proper authorization first. Frustrated, Norman tells him to leave his office.</p><p>Later, Stark has a conversation with Maria Hill and Pepper Potts discussing what Osborn is up to. He states that he deleted the Registration Database from the computers and that if Norman tries to access it all of his systems will get a virus. However, he tells that another instance of the database exists within his brain and that he has a plan to get rid of it but needs their help. Tony tells Pepper to put down Stark Industries and sends Maria Hill on an errand to retrieve a jump drive from FuturePharm, a pharmaceutical subsidiary and then deliver its contents to Captain America. In the meantime Tony works towards slowly deactivating his brain. Osborn calls for Tony to appear in public and answer accusations that he throws at him, and then for his lack of appearance issues an arrest warrant and order for H.A.M.M.E.R. to seize all of Stark’s assets.</p><p>Before leaving for her assignment, Maria Hill has sex with Tony. When she wakes up, she finds a note from Tony telling her to blow up her armory and notices that Stark has already gone off with one of his older suits. Meanwhile, Pepper is frustrated about the state of the company and in her anger destroys a mirror only to discover a secret passageway leading to a secret armor that Tony has designed for her. With the armor, Pepper escapes capture from H.A.M.M.E.R. and Tony, Pepper and Hill, all three become fugitives on the run from H.A.M.M.E.R. and Osborn.</p><p>During his run, Tony is continually forced to downgrade his armor as he loses the skills to monitor his more advanced armors. He also stages a fight with War Machine to make sure that Rhodey is not hunted, as well as runs into Namor who plans to deliver him to Osborn. Tony manages to escape and goes into Russia where the Crimson Dynamo (former enemy turned ally) buys him some time. Frustrated by Dynamo’s denial to allow H.A.M.M.E.R. into his country, he sends Madam Masque who has a history with Tony to find and kill him. Masque finds him with Pepper, whom she holds hostage with a gun on her head and asks Tony to tell her if he has ever loved her.</p><p>Tony stated that he used to but that he no longer does. However, since he has lost most of his memories he cannot recall enough of his past. While they are talking, Pepper manages to break free and tells Tony to run. They exchange a momentary kiss and Iron Man leaves Pepper as Rescue to deal with Madam Masque. Tony then finds refugee in Afghanistan and switches into his oldest armor. Norman Osborn finally manages to confront him and as the Iron Patriot severely beats him in camera. This changes public perception as well as what most of the heroes had thought about Tony. Doctor Donald Blake arrives to cure Tony’s vegetable state.</p><p>Also during Dark Reign, Loki impersonated the Scarlet Witch and chose Iron Man to join a new Avengers team.

The most serious issue is that he's in a persistent vegetative state. His body no longer knows how to breathe on its own. He is in a hospital, in Broxton, Oklahoma, on life support. Osborn wants to pull the plug and kill Stark, but he's unable to due to Tony having a living Will, which grants life or death decisions to his personal physician, Dr. Donald Blake. Blake is at Tony's bedside along with Pepper Potts, Maria Hill, and Captain America. It is revealed that Stark 's body went into the vegetative state on its own, to prevent Osborn from getting any information from Stark, namely the identities of all Registered super-heroes, and the ever-exclusive Repulsor Technology. Stark pre-recorded a transmission into the Rescue armor, that details the steps needed on how to bring back, or \"Reboot\" Stark.</p><p>The first step involves taking the Repulsor battery out of Pepper, and into Tony. This is referred to as the \"Heart\" of the operation as the battery will fuel Tony's biology. The next step involves the data that Maria Hill recovered. The data was a hard drive that plugs into Stark's neck. Prior to upgrading to the Extremis armor, Tony backed himself on the hard drive. This serves as the \"Brain\" of the operation. The final step involves starting up the Repulsor generator. War Machine assists with the stripping of parts from the Rescue armor, specifically, the cables for channeling the Repulsor current. Tony is wheeled to the top of the hospital roof. The Shield of Captain America is placed near Stark , with the cables connected from the Shield to Tony's chest. Dr. Blake transforms into the Mighty Thor, and calls upon a lightning bolt on Cap's Shield. The Shield absorbs the lightning and the current flows from the Shield onto Tony. The operation is unsuccessful, and Stark is still in a coma. Afterwards, Captain America calls a consult, Dr. Stephen Strange to offer his alternative methods.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside Tony's mind, we are given the image of a barren wasteland. Tony is trying to dig up something. He is joined by a couple , Howard and Maria. Every time Stark begins to dig, they are found by machines of his own design and they are blasted. Everything goes white, and the dream begins again and again, with Stark digging a little closer. Eventually, Stark and company are able to dig up an iron chestplate. Fearing the machines, they travel to a empty house. Tony puts on the chestplate, but nothing happens. Howard and Maria are found by the Starktech machines and are captured. Stark escapes capture by hiding in an underground bunker. He is then greeted by Dr. Strange, in astral form, who pledges to help bring Tony back , as \"the world needs its Iron Man\".</p><p>Considering Stark's current state a victory and no longer seeing him a threat, Norman Osborn orders The Hood and his gang to call off their hunt. Madame Masque doesn't accept this and enlists the services of Thunderbolt Ghost, to sneak in and pull the plug on Stark.</p><p>Dr. Strange continues to help Tony find himself inside his own mind, asking Tony to repeat the words, \"I am Iron Man\" over and over again. The two then journey to the bureaucrat to help Howard and Maria. Ghost then locates where Tony's body is being held, shooting Rhodey in the chest as he makes his way to Stark. Tony and Strange then run into one of the Stark sentries, Tony then ask if Strange was scared, which replies by saying that he wasn't actually there, and ask if Tony likes feeling afraid, which Tony tells him that he hates that feeling and fires off a Uni-Beam, destroying the sentry. Tony then looks at Strange, telling him \"I am Iron Man.\" Tony and Strange then make their way to a large complex, Strange then hears something like thunder and disappears. Tony then continues on, but runs into a group of people, who are walking in a pile of blood, that he knows, two of which were Happy Hogan and Yin Sen. Tony then makes it to the top, finding Howard and Maria inside, telling him to take a seat, that this is who they are, who he is, his legacy. Tony then tells them that he's not like them, not anymore, telling them that he chooses his own path, Tony is then consumed by a bright light.</p><p>Back in the real world, Strange and Maria try to hold off Ghost from killing Stark, but Ghost stabs Strange in the chest, and goes forward and begins to try to choke Stark to death. He is then stopped again by Maria, who he easily defeats, but Pepper Potts then claims that she is calling H.A.M.M.E.R. as they speak. Tony then wakes up, taking Ghost's \"Ghost Phone\" and tells him that he number to Stark Industries Seoul was 82-2-738-1059, saying \"It's funny the things you remember.\" Tony then uses the phone and sends Ghost to that number.</p><p>Captain America then arrives, asking Dr. Lisk how Stark was, Lisk then ask Cap if anyone knew how old that back-up Tony used to reboot himself was, saying that there's data missing. That when he talked to Stark, he told him that Cap was back, but didn't specifically say he had died, he then tells Captain America that there are simply things Tony Stark doesn't know. Pepper and Maria then find Tony on the computer, looking up things from the Civil War to Captain America's assassination, and about other recent things, shocked by what he is learning.</p><h3><b>Siege</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724554\" data-ratio=\"0.70117647058824\" data-width=\"1275\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1275px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.1%\" href=\"https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5724554\"><img alt=\"Iron Man during Siege\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 1275w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man during Siege\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 1275w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11127/111271893/5724554-3776968744-11631.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man during Siege</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark was recovering from his reboot in Broxton, Oklahoma under the care of Dr Donald Blake when Norman Osborn's strike force assaulted the floating city of Asgard.

After the arrival of the Void, Tony used his armor to crash the HAMMER Helicarrier into the Sentry/Void, reverting him to Bob Reynolds. This gives Thor the break he needed to bring down the Void for good. during the aftermath, Tony stops Moonstone from escaping and oversees the imprisonment of Norman Osborn.</p><h3>Heroic Age and Fear Itself</h3><p>In the aftermath of Siege, the super human registration act was repealed thanks to the efforts of Steve Rogers, who now took over the position of the overthrown Norman Osborn. Iron Man reunited with Thor and Steve Rogers and rekindled their relationship while setting their past differences aside. Iron Man and Thor were assigned to Avengers along with Bucky Barnes as Captain America while Steve Rogers headed the Secret Avengers. Iron Man was slightly troubled that he may not be able to take orders from Steve, but Steve told him that Maria Hill would oversee the Avengers.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212903\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.52890625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:152.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212903\"><img alt=\"Bleeding Edge armor\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 1255w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 627w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Bleeding Edge armor\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 1280w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 1255w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 627w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/4/40015/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Bleeding Edge armor</figcaption></figure><p>Iron Man, with Thor, the Protector and Ms. Marvel save a crashing plane from destroying the city after Nova crash lands on Earth. Tony and Captain America advise the President that the Phoenix Force is heading back towards Earth as they head to Utopia to take Hope. After Cyclops strikes the first blow at Cap, Iron Man and several other Avenger teams descend from the Helicarrier and attack the X-Men. Tony stops Emma Frost from using her telepathy by using nanites before she turns to diamond and punches him in the stomach. Magneto arrives but is unable to take control of Tony's suit as it is made of carbon nano-fiber tubing. However, Erik does drop a tower of Utopia on top of Iron Man. Tony comes through the rubble and fires 2 million high grade neodymium magnets to stop Magneto but he overpowers them. Iron Man resorts to using his satellites to drain the magnetic power from Jupiter to charge a unibeam and fires on Erik. Magneto still does not go down and destroys the satellites, using them to create his own suit of armor and resorts to a punch out with Iron Man. Tony winds up knocking out Magneto soon after.</p><p>After the battle at Utopia, Iron Man argues with Captain America about the methods he's using to pursue Hope. Tony remains at Avengers Tower, working on a way to stop the Phoenix Force. He discovers that the Phoenix Force was created in the microseconds between cosmic death and rebirth after the Big Bang. He continues working on a \"Phoenix Killer\" but has to crack universal expansion in order to do so. Iron Man joins Cap and the Avengers on the Blue Side of the Moon when they discover that Hope was there. They arrive same time as the X-Men but the fighting stops when Thor crashed onto the Moon from space and the Phoenix Force arrives.

With a new lease on life, Tony rebranded Stark Industries as Stark Unlimited, a think tank for future technologies and ideas for advanced Iron Man armors. However, he was plagued by the thought that he was no longer human and was simply a manufactured simulation of the real Tony Stark. This thought r led him to return to drinking</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He had his suspicions confirmed when he faced off against the combined form of Pym and Ultron. Pym-Ultron had devised a ray gun that would combine technology and biological tissue so that it could remake the world in their image. They tested it on Vision and Wonder Man with the goal of combining Wasp and Jocasta into their bride. Stark shielded them and ended up combined with his armor. After defeating Pym-Ultron, the process to separate him from his armor revealed biological tissue with manufacturing labels.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">His brother Arno took advantage of this revelation by claiming Tony’s whole person was his property since it was his technology that recreated Tony. Thus everything that belonged to Tony actually belonged to Arno. With the full force of Stark Unlimited, Arno created his own armor and took the Iron Man persona for himself, as well as helped push legislation through that would recognize all artificial intelligence as non-sentient intellectual property.</p><h3 dir=\"ltr\">The A.I.

They were a robot rebellion against the new political movement to name artificial intelligence as company property. Stark designed The Thirteenth Floor, a special hideout that could be accessed from any elevator in the city by manufactured beings only. Machine Man and other operatives would recruit other robots and A.I., while Tony planned his new public persona, Mark One, after his first armor.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Using information he got from a mole inside Stark Unlimited, Tony learned that Arno has designed an obedience code that would transform any A.I. connected to the internet into a slave. As the internet has become a necessity to a number of A.I., Tony led an assault on Stark Unlimited. Arno was one step ahead. He knew Tony’s plans. Once Tony and his operatives were in the building, Arno was able to shut them out of the Thirteenth Floor. Nevertheless, Tony is able to disable the obedience code but not without taking major damage.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Friday was able to upload Stark’s consciousness to The Thirteenth Floor, and the A.I.

He moved into a brownstone, started using a simplified Iron Man suit, and resigned from the board at Stark Unlimited. His less tech savvy hero patrols would cause him to cross paths with Hellcat and strike up a romantic partnership.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">His new simplified life would be complicated when a recipient of one of his investment’s turned out to be Korvac. He had developed a lightning experiment that he hoped would repower him and eventually evolve him to godhood.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Korvac assembled a team of Iron Man rogues (plus an enslaved Jim Hammond) to seek out Taa II, Galactus’s ship. Iron Man assembled his own team of street heroes to help him stop Korvac from finding this new power source. However, while Korvac psychically explained he wanted to turn humanity into a hive mind, Stark was mysteriously teleported away to a mysterious village full of other mysteriously teleported people.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Stark would face a special struggle at this village. During one of his confrontations with Korvac, he broke his neck. His teammate, Halcyon, rigged his armor to work as a brace and installed a morphine drip to deal with the pain. Not only is the morphine getting low as he remains at the village, but he also can feel himself getting addicted, a \"demon\" he knows well. After revealing the village as a shame, The Living Tribunal teleports Iron Man and his village ally, Avro-X, to Taa II.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">He was no match for Korvac and his followers, but he was joined by his team just in time. They chased Krovac's team around Taa II, taking them down, one by one, but the mind-controlled Jim Hammond was able to get Korvac to the heart of the ship. Korvac is able to merge with the source of the cosmic power, and feeling he has no other choice, Stark merges with it as well.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The two fight overpowered with the power cosmic until the Living Tribunal and other primordial beings confront them.

He confronted them before they could, but, in the heat of the moment, he realized for far he had drifted.</p><p>He voluntarily gave up the power cosmic and entered rehab for his morphine addiction.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6221157\" data-ratio=\"0.66979166666667\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-6221157\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11129/111294318/6221157-17630126_1430093673728713_3005765356338986372_n.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'1\" (without armor); 6'6\" (with armor)</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 225 lbs (previously without armor); 250 lbs (with armor)</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Black</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Publicly known</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Long Island, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> USA</li><li><strong>Marital Status: </strong>Single</li><li><b>Education:</b> PhDs in Physics and Electrical Engineering</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Avenger, adventurer, inventor, industrialist, CEO of Stark Resilient, founder of the Maria Stark Foundation; former liason between S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, Executive Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.; CEO of Stark Industries, Stark International, Stark Enterprises, Stark Solutions, and Circuits Maximus, US Secretary of Defence, computer technician, mechanical engineer</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> Howard Anthony Walter Stark (father, deceased), Maria Collins Carbonell Stark (mother, deceased), Morgan Stark (cousin), Arno Stark (brother), Edward Stark (uncle, deceased), Isaac Stark Sr., Isaac Stark Jr. (ancestors, deceased)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2042536\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.455\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2042536\"><img alt=\"Armored Avenger\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" data-width=\"659\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg 600w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Armored Avenger\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/4/49355/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px\" data-width=\"659\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Armored Avenger</figcaption></figure><p>Tony Stark's intellect allows him to constantly upgrade his armor designs. Stark recently had to inject himself with the Extremis techno-organic virus to save his life. The effects are that now the inner layers of the Iron Man suit can be stored in the hollows of his bones, and he can control the suit with his mind through direct brain impulses. He can also remotely connect to just about any communication device, including satellites and computers, across the world. Stark can even regenerate organs due to the enhancement. Extremis also allows Stark to interface with his armor in a faster and more efficient manner as well, thus dramatically increasing his response time. Without his armor Tony Stark is considered to be above peak human and has displayed superhuman capabilities such as super human reflexes, His speed, strength and agility without his armor is now considered to be at peak human levels.</p><p>Iron Man's abilities are constantly changing because of his constant technological upgrades on the armors.</p><p>The armor is very durable, capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of punishment. Tony Stark's armor has a muscularly aligned matrix of crystallized iron enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other metals like titanium, which grants him endurance capable of withstanding high caliber bullets with ease. He can withstand rockets, torpedoes and such, although he does take damage.</p><p>The armor also enables Iron Man to fly at high speeds, exceeding the speed of a jet airplane, due to the rocket propelled boots that are placed on the bottom of the armor's boots.</p><p>Iron Man's suit has many power sources, such as solar converters, electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source. The suit is also able to convert nearby energy sources, such as heat or kinetic energy into electricity, or even drain electrical energy directly into the batteries for recharge. Although the suit has some open holes to allow the wearer to breathe normal air, it can be sealed off, allowing the pilot of the suit to go underwater or into space by granting its own life support and limited air supply systems.</p><p>As mentioned, Tony Stark controls the suit mostly by movement as if the armor is his skin and through the Extremis upgrade(before it started to fail), essentially making the suit an extension of his own body. In addition to this however is an internal artificial intelligence operating system that provides strategies, background information on opponents, and on surroundings and the current status of the suit.</p><p>The Extremis upgrade gave him a healing factor and enhanced abilities and could expel the inner-most armor layer in his body then \"will\" the rest of the Extremis armor to attach to him. While wearing the suit, Tony's strength levels are boosted to significant superhuman levels between 50 and 500 Tons of lifting capacity, based on the available power stores and design specifications of the suit in question.</p><p>Stark also has equipped the suit with numerous weapons over the years, making the suit more powerful each time. The most often used weapons are the repulsor rays (magnetically channeled beams of super-heated plasma) that are fired from Iron Man's palms or gauntlets. Other weapons that are built into the armor include the uni-beam projector in its chest (controlling the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum from blinding searchlights to cutting lasers), pulse bolts that pick up kinetic energy along the way, so that they hit harder the further they have to travel, an electromagnetic pulse generator and energy shield, the generation of ultra-freons, the creating and manipulating of magnetic fields, sonic blasts, and a holographic generator to create decoys.</p><p>Tony Stark has also created many specialized models of the armor. Other models that are in his possession include a model for deep-sea diving, for stealth, space travel, etc. He has also enhanced the armor on a few occasions for unique circumstances. For example, Tony Stark has modified suits like the \"Hulkbuster\" heavy armor, composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability to allow it to take on the Incredible Hulk in combat. One time, when Stark had to face Thor, he made an armor modeled on the Destroyer and used a mystical power source.</p><p>While the Iron Man suit is very durable, high amounts of lighting or electricity can make the suit overload, as well as magnets, as this would happen to a regular machine.</p><p>Tony stark is effectively a genius, able to constantly create new and improved technologies and make upgrade after upgrade to his suit of cybernetic armor. Iron Man is able to harness his intelligence and ingenuity in order to allow him to defeat more powerful foes and escape their dangerous traps and machinations. Stark is also a powerful leader, able to command the loyalty and respect of others. Stark has been expertly trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand combat, making him a formidable opponent even without the power suit.</p><p>For more information on Iron Man's various armors see: Iron Man Armor.</p><h2>Iron Man/War Machine</h2><p>One of the most requested and sought after battles in the Marvel Universe has always been War Machine vs Iron man.

In the Ultimate Universe, Antonio \"Tony\" Stark is a wealthy industrialist and a brilliant inventor. Like the original Marvel Universe Tony, he has a dependency on alcohol and a life-threatening affliction. In this case however, his condition is an inoperable brain tumor which could kill him at anytime. For that reason he decides to use his remaining time to the best of his ability, becoming a philanthropist and superhero using the armor he creates.</p><p>In the Ultimate Iron Man limited series, it's revealed that the reason for Tony's unprecedented brilliance is that his body contains a regenerative virus which caused him to grow extra neural tissue throughout his body, effectively expanding his brain. However, a side-effect causes him constant pain, which is mitigated by alcohol one reason why he drinks so heavily. On the upside, the virus also lets him regrow lost limbs and organs with incredible speed, as long as he has enough protein available. His skin is also impregnated with a \"bacterial armor\" that makes him resistant to impact, though it apparently isn't fireproof. The bacteria would eat the skin of anyone who can't regenerate in minutes, which is why he hasn't mass-produced the design.</p><p><b>Super-Human</b></p><p>While forming the original Ultimates, Tony Stark along with Nick Fury are present for the thawing out of Captain America. He goes on to recruit Hank Pym and his wife Janet as they take on their first mission, to stop a rampaging Hulk in Manhattan. Iron Man slams into the Hulk after Giant Man is taken down. Hulk gets up and practically tears Tony from his armor. Tony retaliates with his thought scramblers to buy a quick moment. This buys Wasp some time to get inside Hulk’s head to deliver her sting. Tony hosts a dinner which Captain America and Thor attend. They discuss the Ultimates when Tony reveals his brain tumor to them. He also presents Cap with a gift, his helmet from World War II.</p><p><b>Homeland Security</b></p><p>Tony, Nick Fury and Captain America check in on Wasp who was hospitalized after a domestic dispute with Hank. Later on at the Triskelion, Fury introduces Hawkeye, Black Widow, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to the rest of the team as the newest members. He briefs them on their next mission, the Chitauri, shape shifting aliens who had infiltrated the Nazis have been found.</p><p>The Ultimates and an army of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents head to Micronesia to attack a base but were setup and are taken out by an explosion. The Chitauri launch their invasion and Wasp is taken captive from the hospital by their leader Herr Kleisser. Wasp gets a call out to Tony who saved the group with his force field. The Ultimates teleport to Phoenix, AZ for their final stand against the invasion. Tony catches a large ship and uses all of his power to slow it down and change it’s course to avoid a town. He succeeds but drains all of his power and has to plug into the local grid for a recharge. The Hulk is then brought in to finish Herr Kleisser while Tony handles the Chitauri’s last resort bomb. He comes to the resolution that he can’t disable it and has Thor teleport it to another dimension. Kleisser is defeated and the invasion is stopped.</p><p><strong>Ultimatum </strong></p><p>When Magneto reverses the axis of the Earth's magnetic feilds, it for some reason causes the world to flood. Tony saves Captain America from drowning and they later team with what is left of SHIELD, The Ultimates, and The X-Men to fight Magneto.</p><h4><strong>Ultimate Comics: Ultimates</strong></h4><p><b>The Republic Burns: for more information:</b> Ultimate Comics Ultimates</p><p>While attending a gala in Tokyo hosted by Shinobi Shaw, Tony steps out to his car and takes control of Iron Man via remote. At Fury's orders, he leads a squad of Rocketmen at a blockade in Montevideo. Once boarding the lead ship, Iron Man discovers it was set on a remote course and was armed with a Stark nuclear bomb which detonates. Jarvis revives Tony in the car and once he comes to Tony suits up and flies off to his armory. It is at this time that the Children of Tomorrow from the City have destroyed Asgard, killing its inhabitants. Tony arms Thor with his old power suit and hammer as he is now powerless. Iron Man, alongside Nick Fury, Black Widow, Spider Woman, Hawkeye and Thor lead a wave of helicarriers in a full scale assault on the city. The Ultimates are overpowered as Fury sounds the retreat. Later on Tony has a talk with Thor about fate when he suddenly teleports himself back to the city alone. Tony tells Fury that Thor has left and he plans to join him. Nick convinces him to stay as they cannot face the Children without him.</p><h3>Earth-2149</h3><p><b>For More Information: Marvel Zombies</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493184\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.9946524064171\" data-width=\"935\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 935px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:199.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493184\"><img alt=\"Iron Man: Earth-2149 (Zombiverse).\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" data-width=\"481\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg 935w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg 481w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man: Earth-2149 (Zombiverse).\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg 935w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26163/493184-iron_man2_2149.jpg 481w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" data-width=\"481\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man: Earth-2149 (Zombiverse).</figcaption></figure><p>In the Marvel Zombies reality Iron Man has been turned into a zombie as have most of Earth's heroes. Iron Man is one of the main characters of the Marvel Zombies storyline. Iron Man appears to be one of the uninfected heroes in the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier where the uninfected had met to hear Nick Fury's plan to save Earth from the virus. Iron Man is infected with the virus and he joins the infected zombies on the rampage to find food and consume it. He appears to be one of the zombies left in the Earth after everything was consumed and is one of the zombies to see Silver Surfer come to Earth to tell them that Galactus was coming to eat the planet. The zombies attack him and Iron Man loses his bottom half of his body during the fight but is thrown into the fray by Wolverine. After Silver Surer is subdued, Iron Man becomes one of the few to feast on the Silver Surfer and soon is able to fly again since he had gained a portion of the Surfer's powers. He is one of the zombies seen fighting Galactus, and he retreats to think of a plan to defeat Galactus. He thinks of making a machine where it combines all the zombies new Silver Surfer powers and unleash against Galactus. Iron Man, along with Hulk and Giant Man, build the machine while Galactus is fighting the others. They complete it and the zombies that had gained the Surfer's powers combine their powers into the machine and shoot a beam of the energy at Galactus. Galactus staggers a bit and they shoot a couple more until Galactus falls. Iron Man is one of the zombies that fight the villain zombies to see who would eat Galactus. The heroes easily win and they feed on Galactus, who was becoming conscious and Iron Man becomes one of the few who had gained Galactus's powers. He is seen appearing in an alien world flying with the zombies that had gained Galactus's powers. Later, Iron Man and the zombies are returning to Earth after forty years of consuming the universe. They return to Earth to see that there are still survivors and they attack the remaining survivors. They face opposition from Spider-Man and Luke Cage along with the survivors. Iron Man was the one who had breached the facility they were in and battles Forge, T'Channa (controlled by Colonel America's brain), and several acolytes. The zombies swarm in after the breach has occurred. Giant Man realizes his hunger had disappeared and and tells all the zombies that their hunger is gone. The zombies realize it too and they agree that they stop attacking and spare the survivors. However, an enraged Hulk appears and is hungry for food. Hulk assaults the survivors, but the zombie heroes intervene to save the survivors. Iron Man fights Hulk, but ultimately is killed by Hulk.</p><h3>Earth-20051</h3><p><b>For More Information: Avengers &amp; The Infinity Gauntlet, Marvel Adventures Avengers, Marvel Adventures Iron Man</b></p><p>In the Marvel Adventures reality Iron Man is a member of the Avengers along with Captain America, Spider-Man, the Hulk, Wolverine, Storm and Giant Girl.

This versions personality and origin closely resemble those of the Iron man films with Tony possessing a sharp irreverent wit and having his identity known to the public as well as his biggest goal (at the beginning of the series) being the destruction of stark weapons technology that has fallen into the wrong hands. He also possess absolute belief in science and it's ability to explain away magic. Like the comics he funds the avengers out of his own pocket and has a strong resentment against S.H.E.I.L.D (though he also has a love hate relationship with Maria Hill) He is strong friends with Hank Pym, enough so that he teases him about flirting with wasp though they clash with the ideology and goals of the Avengers. He also has a strong bond with Captain America even taking to heart one of Caps lessons about not forgetting the past while looking to the future. He respects Thor but often clashes with him over the existence of magic and his relationship with Black Panther is similar to that of the comics. He is often frustrated by the Hulks destructive behavior and trades friendly barbs with hawkeye.</p><h4><b>Marvel Anime: Iron Man</b></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936717\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.5454545454545\" data-width=\"792\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 792px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:154.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1936717\"><img alt=\"Poster for Marvel Anime: Iron Man, Featuring Iron Man and Iron Man Dio\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" data-width=\"621\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg 792w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg 621w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Poster for Marvel Anime: Iron Man, Featuring Iron Man and Iron Man Dio\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg 792w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/8/85575/1936717-marvel_ironman_anime_c2e2_poster.jpg 621w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" data-width=\"621\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Poster for Marvel Anime: Iron Man, Featuring Iron Man and Iron Man Dio</figcaption></figure><p>Iron Man is the first show from a production deal between Marvel and the Japanese anime studio Madhouse.

Another doctor, who was also a captive, conducted the surgery on him to save his life, but was unable to remove some of the shrapnel from within his chest. He uses components that were intended to make a weapon to complete a miniature arc reactor that would save his life. Together, him and the doctor create a suit of armor to allow for their escape. Once freed, he continues to upgrade his armor to help save the world per the last wish of his fellow captive, who died during their escape attempt. At the end of the movie, he starts to try and tell the press the classic bodyguard excuse, but in a surprise move admits he's Iron Man to the press. The villain of the film was Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). The movie was released on May 2, 2008 and was rated PG-13.

In the game's story mode, Iron Man arrives at Avengers Mansion, which has been overrun with aliens, and attempts to exterminate the creatures and destroy their computer terminal. After successfully doing so, he then has to defend the communications array that the heroes are using to coordinate their efforts against the invasion. Later, while searching a power plant for information on the invaders, Iron Man encounters Brigade, one of the Imperfects, and manages to defeat him. However, he is ambushed by Niles Van Roekel, who escapes with Brigade before Iron Man can get any answers. Following a battle with an infected Human Torch, Iron Man heads back to Avengers Mansion, where he is once again attacked and ultimately defeated by Van Roekel.</p><h4><b>Marvel Ultimate Alliance</b></h4><p><b>For More Information:</b> Marvel Ultimate Alliance</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5903149\" data-ratio=\"0.71698113207547\" data-width=\"265\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 265px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-5903149\"><img alt=\"Iron Man's various costumes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg 265w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Iron Man's various costumes\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/113509/5903149-5531268374-17757.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px\" data-width=\"265\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Iron Man's various costumes</figcaption></figure><p>Iron Man is a playable character in the game Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

Unlike in the comics, though, Iron Man loses control of the nanites, and the nanite-controlled characters turn against him, and therefore the Pro and Anti Registration sides must unite in order to defeat them.</p><h4><b>Marvel Super Hero Squad</b></h4><p><b>For More Information:</b> Marvel Super Hero Squad</p><p>Iron Man appears as a playable character in the game adaptation of the show of the same name, Marvel Super Hero Squad.
