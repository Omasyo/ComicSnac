Garth, <a href=\"../../light-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Ayla</a>, and their older brother <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Mekt</a> were joy riding when their ship lost power and came down on the world of <a href=\"/korbal/4020-56256/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56256\">Korbal</a>. They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy. After their return with new found powers, Mekt disappeared. Garth left home to look for his brother.

Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/4005-21136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-21136\">President Chu</a>.

They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/4005-2351/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2351\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4466257668712\" data-width=\"815\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093603\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 815w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36257/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad (New Earth)</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/4045-40765/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-40765\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later.

This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal.

Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Silver Age: Lightning Man</h3><p>In the original debut of the Legion of Supervillians, this team came from a time when the Legion of Superheroes had reach adulthood. Among the members it also was Lightning Man, an adult version of Garth. Superboy and later Superman would meet several times this possible future for the Legion. The concept would be revisited after Flashpoint.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/4005-10006/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-10006\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one. On the same adventure, Garth was able to reconstitute his sister, who had been existing as a lightning cloud since her disappearance.</p><h4>Smallville</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759249\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.3157894736842\" data-width=\"380\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 380px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:131.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-759249\"><img alt=\"Lightning Lad on Smallville\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg 380w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lightning Lad on Smallville\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/759249-lightninglad1.jpg 380w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 380px) 100vw, 380px\" data-width=\"380\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lightning Lad on Smallville</figcaption></figure><p>Garth was one of the founding Legionnaires who traveled to 20th century Smallville in the same-titled show, episode called \"Legion.\" He acted and appeared to be the youngest of the founding Legionnaires. Lightning Lad was there alongside Cosmic Boy and Saturn Girl to ward off the <a href=\"/persuader/4005-5940/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5940\">Persuader</a> and help stop Brainiac by any means necessary, including killing Brainiac's host. Clark taught the Legionnaires that killing was never the answer and they decide to adopt a no killing policy in their Legion Constitution upon successfully capturing Brainiac without injuring its host. Garth and the others then returned to the future. Garth was portrayed by Calum Worthy.</p>"
